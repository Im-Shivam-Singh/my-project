# VibeMatch — Project Worklog

## Project Overview
VibeMatch is a mobile-first PWA for finding local parties, connecting with hosts, and building a night out. Built on Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui + Prisma (SQLite). Dark theme with deep purple/black backgrounds and neon pink/violet accents. Max-width 480px container, bottom navigation with floating action button.

Original spec targeted FastAPI + React Vite; adapted to the Next.js stack in this environment while preserving the product vision (screens, endpoints, UX).

## Tech Decisions
- Single `/` route hosts the entire app; client-side screen state via Zustand.
- API routes (Next.js Route Handlers) replace FastAPI endpoints: `/api/parties`, `/api/requests`, `/api/threads`, `/api/messages`.
- Prisma replaces SQLAlchemy; SQLite only.
- Real-time chat via socket.io mini-service on port 3003 (per websocket conventions).
- TanStack Query for server state; Zustand for UI/navigation state.

Task ID: 0
Agent: orchestrator
Task: Initialize project foundation (schema, theme, types, store, API routes, app shell) and plan screen builds.

Work Log:
- Explored existing Next.js scaffold, confirmed dev server running on port 3000.
- Reviewed Prisma schema, globals.css, layout, websocket example, Caddyfile.

Stage Summary:
- Foundation about to be laid: Prisma schema (Party, JoinRequest, User, ChatThread, Message), neon dark theme, Zustand store, API routes, app shell with bottom nav.

---
Task ID: 0 (continued)
Agent: orchestrator
Task: Build complete VibeMatch frontend (all screens), API routes, WebSocket chat service, seed data, and verify end-to-end with agent-browser.

Work Log:
- Prisma schema: User, Party, JoinRequest, ChatThread, Message (SQLite). Pushed with `bun run db:push`.
- Seeded 6 demo users + 8 parties + 1 sample chat thread via scripts/seed.ts.
- API routes (Next.js Route Handlers): GET/POST /api/parties, GET /api/parties/[id], POST /api/requests (+GET), GET/POST /api/threads, GET /api/threads/[id], POST /api/messages, GET/PATCH /api/users, POST /api/auth/otp.
- WebSocket mini-service on port 3003 (mini-services/chat-service) for real-time 1:1 chat (typing indicators, delivery, read receipts relay). Started in background.
- Theme: dark neon (deep purple/black bg, pink/violet/cyan accents), Syne display font, glassmorphism, gradient text, custom animations (slide-up, float, pulse, shimmer).
- App shell: 480px max-width centered container, fixed bottom nav (Explore, Inbox, FAB+, Profile) with floating action button, safe-area insets.
- Screens built: LoginScreen (OTP 2-step + Google/Instagram UI), HomeScreen (Explore feed with city/vibe filters + search + "Hot tonight" section + skeletons + empty states), CreateScreen (Launch Vibe form with cover presets, vibe chips multi-select, range slider, entry types), DetailScreen (cover, host card with rating, facts grid, description, house rules, floating "Request to Connect" drawer with intro textarea), InboxScreen (threads list with unread badges + last message preview), ChatScreen (1:1 chat, typing indicator, read receipts, emoji quick-send, report dialog + block sheet), ProfileScreen (hero, vibe score, stats, activity rows, settings, sign out), EditProfileScreen, MyPartiesScreen, RequestsScreen (host view with All/Pending/Accepted tabs).
- State: Zustand store (auth, navigation, filters, selected ids); TanStack Query for server state.
- Fixed bug: DetailScreen sticky CTA overlapped bottom nav → repositioned to float above nav (bottom-[84px]) with rounded glass bar.

Verification (agent-browser, 390x844 mobile viewport):
- Login: phone + name → Send OTP → dev OTP auto-shown → verify → lands on Explore. ✓
- Explore: 8 seeded parties render from API, "Hot tonight & tomorrow" section, bottom nav present. ✓
- City filter (Goa): correctly shows 2 Goa parties. ✓
- Vibe filter (Boardgames): correctly shows 1 party. ✓
- Search ("warehouse"): correctly finds Warehouse Pulse. ✓
- Detail: cover, host card, facts, about, house rules, Request to Connect button visible above nav. ✓
- Request to Connect: drawer opens, intro textarea, Send Request POSTs → success toast → guest count incremented 27→28 on next load. ✓
- Create: filled form (title, area, Techno+Chill vibes, description) → Launch Vibe POSTs → navigates to new party detail → "Your party" host view. ✓
- My parties: created party ("Test Rooftop") listed with 0/20 going. ✓
- Inbox: empty state initially → after "Message host" from Aria's party, thread appears with last message preview. ✓
- Chat: sent "Hey Aria! Excited for Saturday 🎉" → message rendered, persisted (inbox preview updated). ✓
- Profile: shows "Tester", 1 hosted, vibe score, edit/my-parties/requests/sign-out rows. ✓
- Requests (host view): All/Pending/Accepted tabs, empty state for party with no requests. ✓
- No browser console errors, no runtime errors in dev.log, all API calls 200, chat-service healthy on 3003. ✓

Stage Summary:
- VibeMatch is feature-complete and fully interactive end-to-end. All 7 spec'd screens + 3 extras (edit-profile, my-parties, requests) implemented. All 3 spec'd API endpoints (+threads, messages, users, auth) working. Real-time chat via socket.io. Dark neon mobile-app UX with sticky bottom nav + FAB. PWA manifest configured.
- Ready for the recurring webDevReview cron to iterate on polish & new features.

---
Task ID: 1
Agent: webDevReview (cron round 1)
Task: QA the existing VibeMatch app via agent-browser + VLM, fix bugs, improve styling, and add new features.

## 1. Current Project Status Assessment
- **Dev environment**: Next.js dev server healthy on port 3000; chat-service (socket.io) healthy on port 3003 (verified via EIO polling handshake → HTTP 200). The chat-service had a stale failed-restart log entry but the live process (pid 1718) was serving correctly.
- **Stability**: App was feature-complete and functional (login, explore, detail, request, create, chat, profile all working). No runtime errors during initial regression.
- **QA method**: agent-browser (390×844 mobile viewport) full-flow regression + VLM (glm-4.6v) visual analysis of home, detail, chat, and profile screens.
- **Issues found**:
  1. (Bug, later in round) `DetailScreen` referenced `isLow` which was undefined after a refactor → client-side runtime error on detail open. **Fixed** by re-adding `const isLow = left > 0 && left <= 5;`.
  2. (Bug) `PartyCard` rendered a `<button>` inside a `<button>` (outer card + inner save heart) → invalid HTML hydration error. **Fixed** by converting the outer card to a `<div role="button">` with keyboard handler.
  3. (Styling) VLM flagged: inconsistent card metadata alignment, cramped detail spacing, muted host bio, tiny rating, weak chat status, generic profile settings.

## 2. Goals / Completed Modifications / Verification

### Styling improvements (mandatory)
- **PartyCard**: refactored to a div-based card; consistent 2-col metadata grid; fee badge moved onto cover (bottom-left) for consistent positioning; added per-card save heart (persisted); added `GuestAvatars` stack in card footer for social proof ("+27 going").
- **DetailScreen**: added a dedicated "who's going" section with avatar stack + smart status copy ("Almost full, grab your spot" / "Spots open" / "Sold out — join the waitlist"); enlarged host avatar (56px), bigger display-font name, brighter bio text (`text-foreground/85`), clearer gradient "Message host" CTA separated from "View profile" by a divider; medium-sized vibe badges.
- **ChatScreen**: better intro banner spacing (64px avatar, larger name, pill-styled safety note with Sparkles icon); clearer online status with green dot + "Online now" / "Active recently" / "typing…"; message bubbles now support tap-to-react popover (🔥💜🎉😂👀) with reaction chips rendered under bubbles.
- **ProfileScreen**: vibe score card now shows current tier (Rookie/Riser/Vibe/Legend) with a gradient progress bar to the next tier + "N to {tier}" label; added a 6-badge achievements grid (First Steps, Curator, Host, Rising Star, Social Butterfly, Legend) with unlocked/locked states; settings rows carry colored icons.

### New features (mandatory)
- **Saved/Liked parties** (localStorage-persisted via Zustand `persist` middleware): heart on every PartyCard + DetailScreen save button; new `SavedScreen` (empty state + list); badge counter on Explore header heart + Profile "Saved parties" row. Verified: save → count increments → SavedScreen lists it → unsave works.
- **Onboarding flow** (3 steps: city → vibes → done): shown once after first login (gated by persisted `onboarded` flag); persists selected city to user profile + sets the Explore city filter; skip-friendly. New `OnboardingScreen` + `onboarding` screen type.
- **Explore stories-style vibe carousel**: circular emoji icons (🎧🌙🧊 etc.) above the city chips for fast vibe filtering; replaces the old flat chip row; active state gets gradient ring + label.
- **Chat quick-reply chips**: 5 suggestion chips ("I'm in! 🎉", "What time should I reach?", "Can I bring a +1?", "Is parking available?", "Sounds amazing 🔥") appear above the composer when input is empty and conversation is short (<6 messages); one-tap send.
- **Chat emoji reactions**: tap any message bubble → popover with 5 emojis → reaction chip renders under the bubble with count.
- **GuestAvatars component**: reusable overlapping avatar stack with "+N" overflow pill, used on PartyCard and DetailScreen.

### Verification (agent-browser + VLM)
- Login → onboarding (city=Goa, vibes=Techno+Chill) → Explore shows 2 Goa parties (city filter applied). ✓
- Stories vibe carousel renders; party cards show save hearts + "+27"/"+15" guest stacks. ✓
- VLM on improved home: "stories carousel effectively mirrors social media familiarity… party cards are polished: heart, stacked avatars, metadata clear and cohesive." ✓
- Detail opens without error after `isLow` fix; "who's going" section + improved host card render. VLM: "avatar stack showcases social proof… host card balances visual hierarchy… spacing intentional." ✓
- Chat: quick-reply chips render + send on tap; tap message → reaction popover → 🔥 reaction chip appears under bubble. ✓
- Profile: vibe score 10, "Rookie tier", "40 to Riser" progress bar, achievements grid renders. VLM: "progression tangible and motivating… dark purple theme cohesive." ✓
- Saved: save from card → SavedScreen lists party with "Unsave" state → count persists across navigation. ✓
- `bun run lint` clean (0 errors, 0 warnings). `npx tsc` clean for all app code (only pre-existing examples/skills errors remain). No console errors / hydration errors. All API calls 200. Chat-service HTTP 200. ✓

## 3. Unresolved Issues / Risks / Next-Phase Recommendations
- **Socket "online" indicator**: the chat header sometimes shows "Active recently" instead of "Online now" even when the socket connects via polling through Caddy. The connection works (messages deliver), but the `online` state from `useChatSocket` may not always flip to true on first render. **Next phase**: add a `socket.on("connect")` log + a heartbeat ping to make the online state reliable; consider upgrading to websocket-only transport.
- **Reactions are local-only**: message reactions live in component state (not persisted to DB / broadcast via socket). **Next phase**: add a `reactions` table + `/api/messages/[id]/react` route + socket relay so reactions sync across devices.
- **Quick replies are static**: they don't adapt to conversation context. **Next phase**: generate context-aware quick replies via the LLM skill based on the last message + party context.
- **Saved parties are client-side only**: stored in localStorage per device. **Next phase**: persist to a `SavedParty` table keyed by userId+partyId so saves sync across devices.
- **Onboarding vibe picks aren't used for personalization**: the selected vibes don't yet influence feed ranking. **Next phase**: add a "for you" ranking boost for parties matching onboarding vibes.
- **TypeScript**: minor pre-existing type errors in `src/app/api/threads/route.ts` and `src/app/api/users/route.ts` (non-blocking at runtime, but should be tightened with proper null-handling in the next phase).
- **Priority recommendations for next cron round**: (1) persist reactions + saved parties server-side, (2) add LLM-powered smart quick replies in chat, (3) add a "For You" personalized feed tab using onboarding vibes, (4) add a host analytics dashboard (views, requests, acceptance rate) on the Profile/MyParties screens.

Task ID: 3 (parallel branch B — Reviews)
Agent: sub-agent (Reviews feature)
Task: Build a Reviews section component + write-review dialog and integrate into DetailScreen.

Work Log:
- Read existing patterns: detail-screen.tsx, api.ts (api.listReviews / api.submitReview already added), types.ts (PartyReview type, relativeTime helper), store.ts (currentUser), user-avatar.tsx, rating-pill.tsx, empty-state.tsx, dialog/textarea/button/skeleton UI primitives, globals.css (vibe-gradient-bg, vibe-gradient-text, glass, neon palette).
- Confirmed `/api/reviews` route returns `{ reviews: PartyReview[], avgRating: number, count: number }` on GET and `{ review: PartyReview }` on POST (with upsert semantics — one review per user per party).
- Created `/home/z/my-project/src/components/vibe/reviews-section.tsx` exporting `ReviewsSection({ partyId })`:
  • `useQuery(["reviews", partyId], () => api.listReviews(partyId))` for fetching; loading → `<ReviewsSkeleton>`, error → inline "Couldn't load reviews" card.
  • Summary card: `rounded-3xl border border-border/60 bg-card/50 p-4`. Big avg number (`font-display text-4xl font-extrabold`) with a filled amber star, review count below. Star distribution bars 5..1 (`h-1.5` rounded-full, gradient-filled width = count/total*100%, count on the right).
  • "Write a review" gradient pill button (`vibe-gradient-bg rounded-full`) opens the dialog.
  • Reviews list: each item is `rounded-2xl border border-border/60 bg-card/40 p-3` with `UserAvatar` (36px) + name + relative time on the top row, `Stars` row underneath, comment text below; `hover:border-pink/40` transition for subtle hover affordance.
  • Empty state reuses `EmptyState` (icon=`MessageSquare`) — "No reviews yet — be the first to share your experience".
  • `useMutation` calls `api.submitReview({ partyId, userId: currentUser.id, rating, comment })`; on success: `qc.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["reviews", partyId] })`, sonner success toast, dialog closes. On error: sonner error toast. Throws "Sign in to leave a review" if no currentUser.
- `WriteReviewDialog` sub-component (same file):
  • Title "Review this party" (gradient text), description "Share your experience to help other viber heads".
  • 5 star buttons (44×44, rounded-xl). Hover state fills the hovered level with `vibe-gradient-bg` + white star; unhovered = muted. Click selects rating; live label "Loved it 🔥 / Great time ✨ / It was okay / Not great / Didn't enjoy".
  • `Textarea` (rows=4, maxLength=280) with char counter that turns amber in the last 30 chars; "Min 3 characters" hint on the left.
  • Submit (gradient pill, `Send` icon) disabled until `rating >= 1 && comment.trim().length >= 3 && !submitting`. Cancel = ghost variant. Local state resets when the dialog closes.
- Integrated into `/home/z/my-project/src/screens/detail-screen.tsx`:
  • Added import: `import { ReviewsSection } from "@/components/vibe/reviews-section";` next to the other vibe component imports.
  • Inserted a new `{/* Reviews */}` block rendering `<ReviewsSection partyId={party.id} />` immediately after the House rules `</section>` and before the closing `</div>` of the `space-y-6 p-4` body. Guarded with `party.id &&` for safety. No other DetailScreen code touched.
- Verification:
  • `npx tsc --noEmit` → no errors in `reviews-section.tsx` or `detail-screen.tsx` (only pre-existing errors in `examples/`, `skills/`, and `src/app/api/parties/for-you/route.ts` remain, as noted in worklog Task 1).
  • `bun run lint` → clean (0 errors, 0 warnings).
  • Read both files back; imports, JSX structure, prop wiring, and styling classes all match the spec and existing code conventions.

Stage Summary:
- Reviews feature is fully wired end-to-end: fetch with TanStack Query, optimistic invalidation on submit, server-side upsert (one review/user/party), summary card with distribution bars, list with avatar + stars + relative time, empty + loading + error states, and a polished write-review dialog with interactive star selector and 280-char comment counter. DetailScreen now shows Reviews directly after House rules, before the sticky CTA. No API/types/store changes were needed or made. Ready for the next parallel branch to merge.

Task ID: 4 (branch C — Host Analytics)
Agent: general-purpose
Task: Build a Host Analytics dashboard component and embed it at the top of MyPartiesScreen.

Work Log:
- Read worklog, types.ts (HostAnalytics shape), api.ts (`api.getHostAnalytics`), store.ts, my-parties-screen.tsx, and profile-screen.tsx for stats-grid + progress-bar patterns. Confirmed API route `/api/analytics?hostId=...` returns the HostAnalytics object directly (partyCount, totalViews, totalRequests, acceptanceRate, avgRating, totalGuests, totalCapacity, pending/accepted/rejected, topParties[]).
- Confirmed theme tokens: `--pink #ec4899`, `--violet #a855f7`, `--cyan #22d3ee`, `--background #0a0612`, `--card #140d22`, `--secondary #1c1230`. Verified `vibe-gradient-bg`, `vibe-gradient-text`, and `.fancy-scrollbar` exist in globals.css.
- Created `/home/z/my-project/src/components/vibe/host-analytics.tsx`:
  - `HostAnalytics({ hostId })` — `useQuery(["analytics", hostId], () => api.getHostAnalytics(hostId))`, `staleTime: 30s`, enabled when hostId present.
  - Loading: `HostAnalyticsSkeleton` mirrors the exact layout (header strip, 2×2 stat cards, capacity bar, 3 funnel pills).
  - Empty state (`partyCount === 0`): centered card with TrendingUp icon in pink and copy "No analytics yet" / "Launch your first vibe to see stats".
  - A. Stats grid 2×2: Total Views (Eye/pink), Total Requests (Inbox/violet), Acceptance Rate (CheckCircle/emerald, shown as `N%`), Avg Rating (Star/amber, shown as `N.N` or `—` if 0). Each card: `rounded-2xl border border-border/40 bg-card/40 p-3`, icon top-left in tinted square, `font-display text-xl font-bold` value, `text-[11px] text-muted-foreground` label.
  - B. Capacity bar: label row with Users icon + "{totalGuests} / {totalCapacity} guests confirmed", `h-2 rounded-full bg-secondary` track with `vibe-gradient-bg` inner fill (animated width).
  - C. Request funnel: 3-col grid of pills (Pending amber / Accepted emerald / Rejected rose), each `rounded-xl border p-2 text-center` with count + uppercase label.
  - D. Top parties (max 3, only when present): list of buttons with rank badge (h-6 w-6 rounded-full — `vibe-gradient-bg` with Trophy icon + neon glow for #1, plain `bg-white/5` + number for others), party title (truncate), "{views} views · {requests} requests" sub, trailing Eye icon. Click → `setSelectedPartyId` + `setScreen("detail")`.
  - Hover/active transitions on every interactive element (cards, pills, list rows).
- Modified `/home/z/my-project/src/screens/my-parties-screen.tsx`:
  - Added import: `import { HostAnalytics as HostAnalyticsCard } from "@/components/vibe/host-analytics";` (aliased to avoid clash with the `HostAnalytics` type).
  - Inserted `<HostAnalyticsCard hostId={currentUser.id} />` wrapped in `<section className="mb-1">` at the very top of the `p-4` scroll container, gated behind `currentUser && (...)`. Left the existing parties list / skeleton / empty-state logic untouched.
- Verification: `npx tsc --noEmit` → no errors in host-analytics.tsx or my-parties-screen.tsx (only pre-existing errors in examples/skills/for-you route remain). `npx eslint` on both files → clean (0 warnings, 0 errors). Did not start the dev server per instructions.

Stage Summary:
- Host Analytics dashboard shipped as a self-contained component and embedded at the top of MyPartiesScreen, gated on currentUser. Renders 2×2 stat grid, capacity bar, request-funnel pills, and top-3 parties list; loading skeletons mirror the layout; friendly empty state for new hosts. All imports/types/api helpers/store actions reused from existing codebase; no API routes, types, store, or api.ts were modified. Ready for visual QA in the next agent-browser round.

Task ID: 2
Agent: map-screen-builder (parallel branch A)
Task: Build a new "Map View" screen (`/screens/map-screen.tsx`) — a stylized SVG India map with city clusters, party pins, and a bottom party list. Wire it into the app shell and add a Map button on the Home header.

Work Log:
- Read `worklog.md`, `lib/types.ts`, `lib/store.ts`, `lib/api.ts`, `app-shell.tsx`, `home-screen.tsx`, `saved-screen.tsx`, `party-card.tsx`, `empty-state.tsx`, `bottom-nav.tsx`, and `globals.css` to learn the existing patterns, theme classes (`glass`, `vibe-gradient-text`, `vibe-gradient-bg`, `vibe-pulse`, `fancy-scrollbar`, `no-scrollbar`, `glow-pink`, `glow-violet`), and conventions (Zustand selectors, `useQuery` for `api.listParties`, `PartyCard` + `EmptyState` reuse, "use client" directives).
- Created `/home/z/my-project/src/screens/map-screen.tsx`:
  - Sticky glass header: ChevronLeft back button → `goBack()`, gradient-text "Vibe Map" title with subtitle (party count + live city count), and a "List" toggle button that syncs the selected city into `cityFilter` and calls `setScreen("home")`.
  - Map canvas (max-h-[52vh], dark gradient `from-violet/10 via-background to-cyan/5`) with an inline SVG (viewBox 0 0 100 100) rendering: a radial aura ellipse, a stylized India silhouette path (cubic-quadratic Bezier polygon, not geographically accurate), faint lat/long grid lines, gaussian-blur glow filter, and gradient fills/strokes in violet/pink/cyan.
  - City clusters rendered as absolutely-positioned HTML buttons (z-20) on top of the SVG, positioned from `CITY_COORDS * 100%`. Each cluster has: an outer `animate-ping` ring (violet for default, rose if a live party exists in that city, pink when selected), a blurred halo glow, a main dot (small/large sizes, gradient bg when active, glow-pink when selected), a count badge top-right, a city label below, and a tiny rose "live" dot indicator. Cities with zero parties render smaller and dimmer and are non-interactive.
  - Party pins (z-10, under clusters): only for the selected city, positioned via `partyPinOffset(party.id, party.city)`. Each pin shows a small dot with the party's first-vibe emoji and color-coded by `partyLiveStatus` (rose for `live`, amber for `starting-soon`, gradient otherwise). Live/starting pins get an `animate-ping` ring. Pins are clickable → `setSelectedPartyId` + `setScreen("detail")`. Hover reveals the party title in a small tooltip.
  - Bottom sheet (glass, max-h-[42vh], border-top, with grab handle): horizontal scroll of `CityPill` chips ("All cities" + each city with parties), and a `fancy-scrollbar` overflow-y-auto list of `PartyCard`s for the selected scope. Empty state for zero parties overall and for a city with no parties. Loading skeletons. Includes a section header ("Parties in {city}" with gradient-text or "All cities") + count.
  - Local state `selectedCity: string | null` (null = All cities), initialized from `cityFilter` so navigation context flows in. Tapping a selected city toggles back to "All cities".
  - Error / empty / loading overlays sit centered on the map canvas using `EmptyState` (MapPin / MapIcon) with "Retry" / "Launch a vibe" actions.
- Modified `/home/z/my-project/src/screens/home-screen.tsx`: added `Map as MapIcon` import from lucide-react and inserted a new map-toggle button (icon-only, matches the saved-heart button styling) to the LEFT of the saved-heart button in the header. Clicking calls `setScreen("map")`.
- Modified `/home/z/my-project/src/components/vibe/app-shell.tsx`: added `import { MapScreen } from "@/screens/map-screen";` and registered `{current === "map" && <MapScreen />}` in the screen switch (immediately after the saved case, per spec).
- Verified: `bun run lint` → 0 errors, 0 warnings. `npx tsc --noEmit` → no errors in any of the three target files (only pre-existing errors in `examples/`, `skills/`, and `src/app/api/parties/for-you/route.ts` remain, as noted in Task 1's worklog). Removed an unused `Skeleton` import for hygiene. Did NOT run `bun run dev` per instructions.

Stage Summary:
- Map View screen is fully built and wired in. Mobile-first, dark-neon themed, reuses all existing primitives (`PartyCard`, `EmptyState`, `glass`, gradient utilities). Three files touched: 1 new (`src/screens/map-screen.tsx`), 2 modified (`home-screen.tsx`, `app-shell.tsx`). No changes to `lib/*` or other screens.
- Lint clean. TypeScript clean for all touched files.
- Concerns / next-phase ideas:
  1. The stylized India outline is intentionally artistic; if a more accurate silhouette is desired later, swap `INDIA_PATH` for a real GeoJSON-simplified path.
  2. Party pins can overlap when many parties share a city — `partyPinOffset` jitter is only ±5% so dense cities (e.g. 5+ parties) may still collide. Could add collision-aware layout or a "N more" pin in a future round.
  3. No "live now" filter pill on the map yet — could add a quick filter to dim non-live clusters.
  4. The map is purely visual; no clustering algorithm beyond per-city grouping. If the dataset grows to hundreds of parties per city, consider marker clustering or pagination in the bottom list.
  5. Did not test in a running browser (dev server intentionally left untouched). Recommend the next QA agent verify visually with agent-browser at 390×844: tap each city cluster, verify pins appear, tap a pin to navigate to detail, scroll the bottom list, use the "List" button to return to Home with the city filter applied.

Task ID: 2
Agent: webDevReview (cron round 2)
Task: QA VibeMatch via agent-browser, fix bugs, add new features (For You feed, Map view, Reviews, Host Analytics, Live countdown), and improve styling.

## 1. Current Project Status Assessment
- **Dev environment**: Next.js dev server on port 3000 + chat-service (socket.io) on port 3003 both confirmed running at start of round. Dev server became unstable mid-round — repeatedly died after handling a handful of requests (likely OOM during Turbopack dev recompilation of new routes). Had to restart multiple times for QA. Chat-service stayed up throughout.
- **Stability at start**: Feature-complete from round 1 (login, onboarding, explore feed with stories-style vibe carousel + city chips + search, create, detail with request-to-connect drawer, inbox, real-time chat with reactions + quick replies, profile with vibe tier + achievements, edit-profile, my-parties, requests, saved parties). No runtime errors during initial regression.
- **QA method**: agent-browser (390×844 mobile viewport) + curl endpoint probes + VLM (glm-4.6v) visual analysis.
- **Bug found**:
  1. **Login redirect bug after Zustand persist hydration**: After page refresh, `authed=true` (persisted) but `screen` (not persisted) stayed at its initial value `"login"`. The existing effect only redirected when `screen !== "login"`, so the user was stuck on login even though they were authed. **Fixed** by adding a new effect: when `authed && screen === "login"`, route to `onboarded ? "home" : "onboarding"`.

## 2. Goals / Completed Modifications / Verification

### Bug fixes
- **Login redirect after persist hydration** (`src/components/vibe/app-shell.tsx`): added effect to push authed users off the login screen on rehydration. Verified: refreshed page while authed → correctly lands on Explore (previously stuck on login).

### New features (mandatory)

**1. "For You" personalized feed** (`src/screens/home-screen.tsx` + `src/app/api/parties/for-you/route.ts`)
- New API endpoint `GET /api/parties/for-you?userId=...` ranks parties by vibe overlap with `User.vibePrefs` (saved from onboarding) + city bonus + social proof (guest count) + freshness.
- New `vibePrefs` field on User model (comma-separated vibe tags) — onboarding now saves both `city` and `vibePrefs`.
- HomeScreen now has a "For You / All" tab toggle (visible only when no search/vibe filter is active). For You tab shows the personalized ranking + a "Tuned for your vibe" banner listing matched vibes. Falls back to "All" semantics when search/vibe filter is active.
- `User.vibePrefs` plumbed through all serializers (auth/otp, users PATCH, threads, parties/[id]).

**2. Map View screen** (`src/screens/map-screen.tsx`)
- Stylized SVG map of India (artistic, not real Google Maps) with city clusters at `CITY_COORDS`. Each cluster pulses; selected cluster glows pink. Party pins (with vibe emoji glyph) appear around the selected city using `partyPinOffset()` jitter. Live/starting-soon pins pulse rose/amber.
- Bottom sheet with city pills + scrollable list of `PartyCard`s for the selected scope.
- "List" toggle in header syncs `selectedCity → cityFilter` and routes back to Home.
- New `Map` icon button in HomeScreen header (next to saved heart) opens the map.
- New "map" screen type registered in AppShell.

**3. Reviews feature** (`src/components/vibe/reviews-section.tsx` + `src/app/api/reviews/route.ts`)
- New `Review` model in Prisma (partyId, userId, rating 1..5, comment) with `@@unique([partyId, userId])` to allow one review per user per party.
- New API: `GET /api/reviews?partyId=...` (returns reviews + avgRating + count) and `POST /api/reviews` (upserts review).
- `ReviewsSection` component integrated into DetailScreen after House rules: summary card (big avg rating + star distribution bars), write-a-review button → Dialog with 5-star picker + comment textarea (280 char limit + counter), list of reviews with user avatar/name/stars/comment/relative time.
- `User.reviews` and `Party.reviews` relations added to schema.

**4. Host Analytics dashboard** (`src/components/vibe/host-analytics.tsx` + `src/app/api/analytics/route.ts`)
- New API: `GET /api/analytics?hostId=...` aggregates totalViews, partyCount, totalGuests, totalCapacity, totalRequests, accepted/pending/rejected counts, acceptanceRate, avgRating, reviewCount, and top 5 parties by views.
- `HostAnalytics` component integrated at top of MyPartiesScreen: 2×2 stats grid (views/requests/acceptance rate/avg rating), capacity utilization bar, request funnel pills (pending/accepted/rejected), top 3 parties list with rank badges. Loading skeleton + empty state.
- Stat cards use tinted icon backgrounds (pink/violet/emerald/amber) for visual variety.

**5. Live countdown timers + "Live now" badges** (`src/components/vibe/live-countdown.tsx`)
- New `LiveCountdown` component shows party status: "Live now" (rose, pulsing ring), "Starts in 2h 15m" (amber), "Today · in 5h" (emerald), "Starts in 3d" (violet), "Ended" (muted). Self-updates every 30s.
- New helpers in `types.ts`: `partyLiveStatus()` returns `"live" | "starting-soon" | "today" | "upcoming" | "past"`, `countdownTo()` returns humanized countdown string.
- Integrated into `PartyCard`: live parties get a rose top-edge strip + rose border glow + LiveCountdown chip below the slots chip (only when live/starting-soon).
- Integrated into `DetailScreen`: LiveCountdown badge (size md) appears next to the party title.

**6. Server-side accept/decline for join requests** (`src/app/api/requests/[id]/route.ts` + `src/screens/requests-screen.tsx`)
- New `PATCH /api/requests/[id]` endpoint updates request status. On rejection of a previously-accepted/pending request, decrements `party.guestCount` (frees the slot). On re-acceptance of a rejected request, re-increments.
- `RequestsScreen` now uses `useMutation` + `api.updateRequest()` for real accept/decline (was previously toast-only). Invalidates `["requests"]`, `["parties"]`, and `["analytics"]` queries so the UI stays consistent.

**7. Party view tracking** (`src/app/api/views/route.ts` was already present; now wired up)
- `DetailScreen` now calls `api.recordView(partyId, userId)` on mount via `useEffect`, so hosts see real view counts in their analytics dashboard.

### Styling improvements (mandatory)

**Global animations added** (`src/app/globals.css`):
- `animate-screen-in`: subtle translateY+scale entrance, used by AppShell's keyed screen wrapper so every screen transition gets a smooth 0.28s entrance.
- `animate-stagger`: for list item entrance animations.
- `vibe-skeleton`: vivid pink/violet shimmer skeleton background (more on-brand than the default).
- `animate-pop-in`: spring-easing pop for badges/chips/avatars.
- `vibe-live-ring`: pulsing rose box-shadow ring for "Live now" badges.
- `animate-ticker`: number counter entrance.
- `press-feedback`: active:scale(0.97) tap feedback class, applied to PartyCard.

**Screen transitions**: AppShell now wraps the screen in a `key={current}` div with `animate-screen-in` so every navigation triggers a subtle slide-up + scale-in transition.

**PartyCard polish**:
- Live parties get a rose top-edge gradient strip + rose border glow.
- LiveCountdown chip appears below the slots chip for live/starting-soon parties.
- Added `press-feedback` class for tap scale animation.

**DetailScreen polish**:
- LiveCountdown badge next to the title (size md).
- Title and LiveCountdown share a flex row with `justify-between` so they don't overlap.

**LiveCountdown component**:
- Live status uses `vibe-live-ring` (pulsing rose box-shadow) + `animate-pulse` for maximum visual emphasis.
- Size variants (sm for cards, md for detail header).

### Seed data extended (`scripts/seed-extras.ts`)
- Set `vibePrefs` on all existing demo users based on their host style (Aria → Techno/EDM/Chill, Kabir → BYOB/Chill/Retro, etc.).
- Added 5 demo reviews on the first 5 parties (rating 4-5 stars with realistic comments).
- Distributed 30-90 anonymous party views across the first 5 parties so the analytics dashboard shows non-zero view counts.
- Added 1 sample accepted join request so acceptance rate > 0% for the demo host.

### Verification
- `bun run lint`: 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors in app code (only pre-existing errors in `examples/` and `skills/` directories remain).
- API endpoint probes (curl, all 200): `/api/analytics?hostId=...`, `/api/parties/for-you?userId=...`, `/api/reviews?partyId=...` (POST + GET), `/api/parties`, `/`.
- agent-browser flow verified: login → onboarding (city=Mumbai, vibes=Techno+Chill) → Explore shows "For You / All" tab toggle + "Tuned for your vibe" banner with matched vibes. ✓
- VLM analysis of login screen: "visually appealing and well-structured, with a clear hierarchy and modern color scheme" — confirmed dark neon theme renders correctly. ✓
- Data verified: analytics returns `totalViews=170, partyCount=1, acceptedRequests=1, acceptanceRate=100, reviewCount=5, avgRating=4.8` for the seed host. ✓

## 3. Unresolved Issues / Risks / Next-Phase Recommendations

### Known issues from this round
- **Dev server instability**: the Next.js 16 Turbopack dev server repeatedly died after handling ~5-10 requests this round. Likely OOM during on-demand route compilation (especially after Prisma client regeneration for the new `Review` model + `vibePrefs` field). Restarting dev + clearing `.next` cache recovered it each time, but it made sustained QA testing difficult. **Recommendation**: in the next round, consider (1) bumping the dev server's `--max-old-space-size`, (2) pre-compiling all routes with a warmup script, or (3) switching to webpack dev mode temporarily to see if Turbopack is the culprit.
- **For You feed ranking is basic**: the current scoring (vibe overlap × 0.55 + city bonus + social proof + freshness) is a reasonable starting point but doesn't learn from user behavior. **Next phase**: incorporate view/save/request history into the ranking (collaborative filtering or a simple "users who viewed X also viewed Y" signal).
- **Map view is stylized, not geographic**: the India outline is an artistic Bezier path, not a real map. Pin jitter is only ±5%, so dense cities (5+ parties) may have overlapping pins. **Next phase**: swap `INDIA_PATH` for a real GeoJSON-simplified path; add collision-aware pin layout; consider using Leaflet/MapLibre if a real map is wanted.
- **Reviews have no moderation**: any authed user can submit a review for any party (no attendance check). **Next phase**: gate review submission behind an accepted JoinRequest, or allow reviews only after the party's end time.
- **Analytics has no time range**: all stats are all-time. **Next phase**: add `?range=7d|30d|all` query param to the analytics endpoint + a time-range selector on the dashboard.

### Priority recommendations for next cron round
1. **Persist message reactions server-side** (was also flagged in round 1): add a `Reaction` model + `/api/messages/[id]/react` route + socket relay so reactions sync across devices. Currently reactions are component-local only.
2. **LLM-powered smart quick replies in chat**: use the LLM skill to generate context-aware quick replies based on the last message + party context. Currently quick replies are static.
3. **RSVP / "I'm going" flow**: the `JoinRequest` model is more like "ask to connect" — there's no explicit RSVP. Add an "I'm going" button on the detail screen (post-acceptance) that adds the user to a visible attendee list, powering a real `GuestAvatars` stack instead of the current deterministic-pick demo.
4. **Public host profile view**: the chat header + detail host card both currently toast "Profile coming soon". Build a `HostProfileScreen` showing the host's bio, vibe score, all hosted parties, reviews received, and a "Message host" CTA.
5. **Push notifications UI**: round 1 left "Notifications coming soon" as a toast. Build a notifications screen (likes, requests, messages, reviews) with a bell badge on the bottom nav.
6. **Dev server stability investigation**: see above — this round's biggest time sink was the dev server dying mid-QA. Worth root-causing.

---
Task ID: 3
Agent: webDevReview (cron round 3 — user-requested restyle + map feature)
Task: User asked to (1) make the theme "more classic — dark black and gold" with glassmorphism, and (2) add a map view where users can see parties within a few kilometres as icons, with animation on each icon showing "how fun" the party is.

## 1. Current Project Status Assessment
- **Dev environment**: Next.js dev server on port 3000 + chat-service (socket.io) on port 3003 both running. Dev server was restarted once mid-round to pick up the new Prisma schema (Party.lat / Party.lng) after `bun run db:push` — the previous server instance was holding a stale Prisma Client and returning `null` for the new fields.
- **Stability**: clean lint, clean `tsc --noEmit`, no runtime errors in `dev.log`. All API routes return 200.
- **QA method**: agent-browser (mobile viewport) + VLM (glm-4.6v) visual analysis on key screenshots + curl probes for the new proximity API.
- **Bugs found & fixed this round**:
  1. **Stale Prisma Client after schema push**: after adding `lat`/`lng` to Party and running `bun run db:push`, the running dev server still returned `lat: null, lng: null`. Fixed by killing the old dev process, clearing `.next/`, and restarting `bun run dev`. Verified: `/api/parties?lat=...&lng=...&radiusKm=...` now returns real coordinates.
  2. **City double-filter on map**: clicking a city dot set `userLocation` but left the explore `cityFilter` at the previous city, so the proximity query was filtering by both the new city's coords AND the old city's name → 0 results. Fixed by having `switchCity()` also call `setCityFilter()` so the store stays consistent.
  3. **"You are here" rings blocking pin clicks**: the pulsing rings around the center marker had `absolute` positioning without `pointer-events-none`, so agent-browser's hit-tester (and any nearby pin click) landed on the ring instead of the pin. Fixed by adding `pointer-events-none` to the ring spans.
  4. **Bottom sheet list clipped by bottom nav**: added `mb-20` to the map's bottom sheet `<section>` + bumped the list's `pb-6` so the last party card is never hidden behind the fixed bottom nav.

## 2. Goals / Completed Modifications / Verification

### A. Theme overhaul — classic black + gold + glassmorphism (mandatory)

**`src/app/globals.css`** — full rewrite of the palette + utilities:
- New gold family: `--gold #d4af37`, `--gold-bright #f0c75e`, `--gold-deep #8b6914`, `--gold-light #f9e4a0`.
- Background `#060606` (near-black), foreground `#f5e9c8` (warm cream), card `#0e0c08` (warm dark brown).
- Aliased `--pink`/`--violet`/`--cyan` → all gold-family so legacy utilities (`text-pink`, `bg-violet/30`, etc.) automatically pick up the new theme without touching every component.
- Body background: triple radial gradient (gold top-right, champagne mid-left, deep gold bottom-center) for a warm luxury vignette.
- New utilities: `.glass-strong` (denser frosted panel for headers/bottom sheets), `.gold-foil` (premium emphasis surface), `.glow-gold` / `.glow-gold-strong` (warm gold shadows).
- `.glass` upgraded: translucent dark gradient + `backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(150%)` + inset gold inner glow.
- `.vibe-gradient-text` / `.vibe-gradient-bg` / `.vibe-gradient-border` all now use gold gradients.
- New "fun-meter" keyframes: `fun-breathe`, `fun-pulse`, `fun-bounce`, `fun-lit`, `fun-sparkle-ring`, `fun-spark` (driving the map pin animations).
- `here-pulse` keyframe for the "you are here" marker.

**Component restyles (gold theme)**:
- `party-card.tsx`: hover border `gold/50`, glow `rgba(212,175,55)`, fee badge `text-gold-light`, save heart `fill-gold`, metadata icons `text-gold/80`, footer divider `border-gold/12`.
- `vibe-badge.tsx`: fallback + `VIBE_COLORS` rewritten to a unified amber/yellow/gold palette (no more fuchsia/purple/cyan).
- `bottom-nav.tsx`: FAB is now a gold disc with a black `+` icon and an inner foil highlight; nav bar uses `glass-strong` with `border-gold/15`; active state `text-gold` + `bg-gold/15`.
- `live-countdown.tsx`: all status styles now use gold tones (`bg-gold/20 border-gold/50 text-gold-light`) instead of rose/amber/violet.
- `home-screen.tsx`: header buttons `text-gold hover:bg-gold/10`, search input `border-gold/20 focus:border-gold/60`, Host CTA `vibe-gradient-bg text-black`, VibeStory active = gold border + gold gradient, CityChip active = gold gradient, For You banner uses `gold-foil` surface.
- `login-screen.tsx`: brighter gold background blobs (opacity bumped from /15 → /30) so the glassmorphism reads through the translucent card; card restyled with explicit `linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(24,20,13,0.55), rgba(10,8,5,0.45))` + `backdrop-blur-2xl` + gold inset shadow + `vibe-gradient-border`.

**VLM verification (glm-4.6v)**:
- Login screen: "black + gold luxury theme", "subtly translucent, frosted-glass effect", "soft gold glow emanates from the edges", "glowing gold blobs in the background", "classic and premium look". ✓
- Explore feed + map: "deep black, with gold accents for text, icons, buttons" — confirmed across all screens.

### B. Map view — parties within a few km as animated fun-level icons (mandatory)

**New schema + data**:
- `prisma/schema.prisma`: added `lat Float?` + `lng Float?` to `Party`. Pushed to DB.
- `scripts/seed-geo.ts`: new seed script that walks every party and assigns real lat/lng based on its area (hand-picked offsets for Hauz Khas, Bandstand, Indiranagar, Koregaon Park, Anjuna, etc.) with a deterministic hash fallback. Seeded all 9 existing parties with coords.

**New types/helpers** (`src/lib/types.ts`):
- `Party.lat?` + `Party.lng?` + `PartyCreateInput.lat/lng?`.
- `CITY_CENTERS` — real lat/lng for Delhi / Mumbai / Bangalore / Goa / Pune.
- `haversineKm(a, b)` — great-circle distance in km.
- `projectLatLng(point, center, pixelsPerKm)` — equirectangular projection for the local map (good enough for a few-km view).
- `funScore(p)` → 0..100: crowd fill ×50 + vibe variety ×20 + live bonus (25/18/10/0) + free-entry bonus ×5.
- `funTier(score)` → `"low" | "warm" | "lively" | "lit"`.
- `FUN_TIER_META` — per-tier ring class, animation class, glow class, label.
- `partyGeoFallback(seed, city)` + `partyCoords(p)` — resolve coords for parties without stored lat/lng.
- `VIBE_COLORS` rewritten to a unified gold palette.

**New API**:
- `GET /api/parties?lat=..&lng=..&radiusKm=..` — proximity filter using haversine + fallback coords. Keeps existing `city`/`vibe`/`q` filters composable.
- `api.listPartiesNear({ lat, lng, radiusKm, city })` client helper.
- Serializers in `parties/route.ts`, `parties/[id]/route.ts`, `parties/for-you/route.ts` all updated to include `lat`/`lng`.

**Store** (`src/lib/store.ts`):
- New `userLocation: { lat, lng, label } | null` + `setUserLocation`. Persisted to localStorage so the map remembers the user's chosen city across refreshes.

**Map screen rewrite** (`src/screens/map-screen.tsx` — full rewrite):
- Real local map centered on the user's location (stored userLocation → cityFilter center → India midpoint).
- Concentric distance rings (25/50/75/100% of active radius) with km labels.
- "You are here" marker in the center with `here-pulse` rings + gold disc.
- Each party is a glassy gold disc pin with the vibe emoji, projected at its real lat/lng offset from center. Pin size + animation scale with fun tier:
  - **low** (0-34): 32px, `fun-breathe` (3.2s gentle scale)
  - **warm** (35-59): 36px, `fun-pulse` (2.2s soft pulse + halo)
  - **lively** (60-79): 40px, `fun-bounce` (1.6s cubic-bezier bounce)
  - **lit** (80-100): 44px, `fun-lit` (1.3s energetic bounce + brightness pulse) + rotating `fun-sparkle-ring` + 3 floating `fun-spark` particles
- Each pin shows a distance chip (`5.4k` / `800m`) at its base.
- Hover/tap tooltip with title + tier label + score.
- Pin tail (rotated square) pointing down to the exact spot.
- Radius selector pills: 1km / 2km / 5km / 10km / 25km.
- "Live only" filter toggle (gold ring pulse when active).
- "My GPS" button — uses `navigator.geolocation` to center on the user's real location.
- City switcher dots: India / Delhi / Mumbai / Bangalore / Goa / Pune.
- Bottom sheet lists nearby parties sorted by distance, each with a distance chip + fun-tier chip overlay.

**VLM verification**:
- "Black + gold theme" ✓
- "Party pins visible as circular gold disc icons on the map" ✓
- "Distance rings with labels (6.25km, 12.5km, 18.75km, 25km)" ✓
- "'You' marker is centered on the map" ✓
- "Bottom sheet lists 3 parties, with distance chips (e.g., 4.4 km)" ✓
- "Subtle glow or pulse effect" on pins ✓
- "No obvious overlap or clipping" ✓

### Verification
- `bun run lint`: 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors in app code.
- API probes: `/api/parties?lat=28.55&lng=77.19&radiusKm=5` → 1 party (Hauz Khas), `/api/parties?lat=19.076&lng=72.8777&radiusKm=25` → 3 Mumbai parties. ✓
- agent-browser flow verified: login → onboarding (Delhi + Techno/Chill/EDM) → Explore → open map → switch to Mumbai → 25km → 3 pins render with distances (4.4km, 7.9km, 9.3km) + tiers (Warming up, Low-key, Warming up) → click pin → Detail screen loads. ✓
- agent-browser flow verified: switch to Delhi → 25km → 2 pins (5.4km, 7.0km) → click pin → Detail. ✓

## 3. Unresolved Issues / Risks / Next-Phase Recommendations

### Known limitations from this round
- **Fun score is heuristic, not learned**: `funScore` combines crowd fill + vibe variety + live status + free entry. It doesn't yet factor in real-time signals (recent joins, message velocity, photo uploads). **Next phase**: incorporate live RSVP velocity + chat activity into the score.
- **Map projection is equirectangular**: fine for a 1-25km view but distorts at country scale. The "India" city-dot falls back to mid-India (20.59, 78.96) which makes the local-map rings meaningless at that zoom. **Next phase**: either hide the rings when `radius > 50km`, or swap to a real map library (Leaflet/MapLibre) if a true pan-and-zoom map is wanted.
- **Pin collision at small radii**: when 2+ parties share the same venue (rare in seed data), their pins overlap exactly. No collision-aware layout yet. **Next phase**: add a small angular jitter when pins are within ~8px of each other.
- **No geolocation permission prompt UI**: `useMyLocation` silently fails if the user denies. **Next phase**: show a toast guiding the user to enable location permissions.
- **Live-only filter doesn't dim non-live pins**: it hides them entirely. Could instead dim them so the user still sees context. **Next phase**: toggle between "hide" and "dim" modes.
- **Glassmorphism depends on backdrop content**: on screens with no background blobs (e.g. chat, inbox) the glass panels read as near-opaque dark. Consider adding a subtle gold radial behind every screen for consistency.

### Priority recommendations for next cron round
1. **Carry the gold theme through the remaining screens** that weren't touched this round: `detail-screen`, `create-screen`, `inbox-screen`, `chat-screen`, `profile-screen`, `edit-profile-screen`, `my-parties-screen`, `requests-screen`, `saved-screen`, `onboarding-screen`. They still use legacy `border-pink/40`, `text-violet`, `from-violet/40` etc. — which now alias to gold so they're not broken, but they could be polished to use the new `gold`/`gold-bright`/`gold-light` tokens directly for crisper theming.
2. **Persist message reactions server-side** (flagged since round 1, still open): add a `Reaction` model + `/api/messages/[id]/react` route + socket relay.
3. **RSVP / "I'm going" flow** to power real attendee lists instead of deterministic demo avatars — would also feed real crowd data into `funScore`.
4. **Public host profile screen** — the chat header + detail host card still toast "Profile coming soon".
5. **Push notifications screen** — bell badge on bottom nav + a notifications screen (likes, requests, messages, reviews).
6. **LLM-powered smart quick replies in chat** — use the LLM skill to generate context-aware replies based on the last message + party context.
7. **Map "directions" button** — on the detail screen, add a "Get directions" button that opens Google Maps with the party's lat/lng.

Task ID: 2-d
Agent: general-purpose (map screen)
Task: Enhance map-screen to Gen Z neon palette with cooler per-tier animations and richer interactions

Work Log:
- Read worklog.md + existing map-screen.tsx + types.ts to confirm FUN_TIER_META now exposes dotClass/textClass/chipClass/sparkClass (cyan/violet/pink/lime+orange per tier) and that the CSS animations (fun-breathe / fun-pulse / fun-bounce / fun-lit / fun-sparkle-ring / fun-spark / here-pulse / holo-spin / vibe-live-ring / vibe-pulse / vibe-float / vibe-skeleton / animate-pop-in) are all already Gen Z colored.
- Full rewrite of `/home/z/my-project/src/screens/map-screen.tsx` (585 → 906 lines). Replaced all hardcoded gold/amber styling with per-tier neon from FUN_TIER_META + the Gen Z utility classes (vibe-gradient-bg/text/border, glass/glass-strong, glow-pink/cyan, text-glow-pink/cyan).
- Header: slim glass-strong bar with title "Map" in `vibe-gradient-text` + `font-display`, radius summary ("within 5km of Mumbai") in cyan, live-count in pink with `text-glow-pink`. Back button + List toggle preserved.
- Radius pills (1km/2km/5km/10km/25km): glass + violet border when inactive; `vibe-gradient-bg` + `glow-pink` + `scale-105` when active.
- Live-only toggle: when active = `vibe-gradient-bg` + `vibe-live-ring` (pink pulse) + `glow-pink` + `scale-105`; when inactive = plain glass + violet border. **Behavior change per worklog recommendation**: instead of filtering non-live parties out, the toggle now sets `dimmed = liveOnly && !isLive` and renders those pins / rows at `opacity-40`. Live parties bubble to the top of the bottom sheet when liveOnly is on; everything stays sorted by distance otherwise.
- Map background: aurora triple-radial gradient (pink top-right, cyan bottom-left, violet center) at low opacity + a faint violet dot-grid texture masked to a soft ellipse for the "tech map" feel.
- Distance rings: rainbow/holo — ring 1 cyan, ring 2 violet, ring 3 pink, ring 4 acid — each a dashed SVG circle with a `drop-shadow` glow in its tier color, plus a colored km label chip (`bg-cyan-500/25 border-cyan-400/50 text-cyan-100` etc.). Faint violet crosshair lines through the center.
- "You are here" marker: pink/cyan `vibe-gradient-bg` disc with a white center dot, surrounded by two `here-pulse` rings (pink + cyan), plus a `holo-spin` dashed ring. "You" label in pink with `text-glow-pink`.
- Party pins: glassy disc with the party's vibe emoji, ringed by `tier.ringClass`, glowing with `tier.glowClass`, animating with `tier.animClass`. Size scales with tier (low 32px, warm 36px, lively 40px, lit 44px). Lit tier adds the rotating `fun-sparkle-ring` (lime→coral conic gradient) + 3 `fun-spark` particles using `tier.sparkClass` (orange-400). Distance chip at the pin's base uses `tier.chipClass`. Pin tail (rotated diamond) uses `tier.dotClass` for fill + `tier.ringClass` for the edge.
- Pin tooltip on hover/focus: `glass-strong` card with `animate-pop-in` showing the party title in `font-display`, the tier label + score in `tier.textClass` with a `tier.dotClass` dot, a tiny fun-score progress bar with a tier gradient fill (cyan/violet/pink/lime+orange via local `TIER_BAR` map), and the distance in cyan. Tooltip auto-shows when a pin or bottom-sheet row is hovered (shared `hoveredId` state — hovering a row highlights its pin on the map and vice versa).
- "My GPS" button: glass-strong circle (44px) with a cyan `Crosshair` icon + `glow-cyan` border. While locating, swaps to a spinner built from `vibe-pulse` + `animate-spin` cyan ring. Silent-fail geolocation preserved.
- City switcher dots (India / Delhi / Mumbai / Bangalore / Goa / Pune): inactive = small 12px glass dot with violet border (no label); active = 14px `vibe-gradient-bg` dot + `glow-pink` + `scale-110` + the city label appearing next to it in `text-glow-pink`.
- Bottom sheet: `glass-strong` panel with a holo top accent line (pink→violet→cyan) and a gradient drag-handle bar. Header "Nearby parties" in `vibe-gradient-text` + a pink count badge + "sorted by distance" muted. Each row is a custom glass mini-card (no longer PartyCard): vibe emoji in a tier-colored ring with `tier.glowClass`, title in `font-display`, fun-tier label chip via `tier.chipClass`, a pulsing pink "Live" dot if live, and a tier-colored distance chip. Hovered/selected row gets `glow-pink` + a left neon accent bar (pink→violet→cyan gradient).
- Loading state: 3 `vibe-skeleton` rows in the bottom sheet + a `vibe-pulse` Sparkles chip at the map center ("Scanning the area…").
- Empty state: centered glass-strong card with a floating 🗺️ emoji (`vibe-float`), "No parties nearby" in `vibe-gradient-text`, and a context-aware hint (widen radius / toggle off live / launch a vibe). Button adapts: "Show all parties" when liveOnly is on, else "Launch a vibe".
- Error state: existing `EmptyState` kept, but retry button now uses `vibe-gradient-bg` + `glow-pink`.
- Collision-aware jitter (open recommendation from worklog): added an O(n²) relaxation pass over the projected pins in a `projectedParties` useMemo. For any pair within 12px, both pins are nudged apart along the connecting axis (with a small +1px buffer); exact-overlap pairs get a deterministic diagonal offset. Runs 3 passes for convergence, then re-clamps to the canvas so no pin escapes. Verified the original seed data (Mumbai 3 pins, Delhi 2 pins) still renders cleanly with no perfect overlaps.
- Preserved ALL existing functionality: geolocation via `navigator.geolocation`, radius filter (1/2/5/10/25km), city switching via `switchCity` (which still syncs the explore `cityFilter`), proximity API call via `api.listPartiesNear`, pin click → `setSelectedPartyId` + `setScreen("detail")`, bottom sheet, live-only toggle (now dimming instead of hiding), the equirectangular `projectLatLng` projection (no Leaflet/Mapbox added), the 480px mobile-first container, and the bottom-sheet `mb-20` so it clears the bottom nav.
- Removed the unused `LocateFixed` and `PartyCard` imports (the bottom sheet now uses custom mini-cards per the spec). Added `Crosshair` and `FunTier` imports.
- Verified: `bun run lint` → 0 errors, 0 warnings. `npx tsc --noEmit` → no errors in `src/` (only pre-existing errors in `examples/` + `skills/` directories remain, untouched). Dev server on port 3000 still responds HTTP 200 after the edit.

Stage Summary:
- Single file changed: `/home/z/my-project/src/screens/map-screen.tsx` (full rewrite, 585 → 906 lines).
- Map is now fully Gen Z neon: aurora backdrop + dot-grid + rainbow/holo distance rings + per-tier neon pins (cyan/violet/pink/lime) with breathing/pulsing/bouncing/lit animations, lit-tier sparkle ring + spark particles, pink/cyan "You" marker with holo-spin ring, glass-strong bottom sheet with holo top border + gradient drag handle + custom mini-card rows.
- New logic added: (1) live-only toggle now DIMS non-live pins/rows to opacity-40 instead of hiding them (with live-first sort when active), (2) O(n²) collision-aware jitter over projected pins (3 relaxation passes + re-clamp), (3) shared `hoveredId` cross-highlights pins and bottom-sheet rows, (4) tooltip shows tier-colored dot + tier gradient progress bar + distance.
- All prior functionality preserved (geolocation, radius/city/live filters, proximity API call, pin→detail navigation, bottom sheet, equirectangular projection, mobile-first 480px layout, mb-20 nav clearance).
- No new npm dependencies. No other files touched.

Task: Restyle home, login, detail, create screens to Gen Z neon palette

Work Log:
- Read worklog history + globals.css to confirm Gen Z tokens (pink/violet/cyan/acid/coral/sunshine, glass/glow/aurora utilities) and previous gold→pink aliasing decisions.
- Read all 4 target screens to map structure before editing.
- login-screen.tsx: swapped gold aurora blobs for tri-color pink/cyan/violet `aurora-drift` blobs + floating ✨/💫 emoji accents; bumped wordmark to `text-5xl` + `text-glow-pink`; converted card to `glass` + `vibe-gradient-border` + `glow-violet`; restyled phone/name inputs to dark-violet fields with cyan focus ring + cyan labels; Send/Verify buttons now `vibe-gradient-bg` + `glow-pink` + `active:scale-95`; InputOTPSlots overridden to monospaced glowing cyan boxes (h-12 w-12, bg-cyan/10, border-cyan/40, text-glow-cyan); Dev OTP text in acid green; social-login divider + buttons use violet/cyan/pink hover rings.
- home-screen.tsx: imported `Bell` + `VIBE_COLORS`; root div gets `animate-screen-in`; header border switched to `border-violet/20`; added glass location pill with pulsing coral MapPin + city, and a `vibe-gradient-text` "Tonight in {city}" headline; added decorative notification bell (role=status) with `vibe-live-ring` pink dot; Map/Saved/Host buttons restyled — Map=cyan glow, Saved=pink glow + glow-pink badge, Host CTA=`vibe-gradient-bg-warm` + `glow-pink`; search bar = glass + cyan focus ring; VibeStory redesigned with a layered spinning `vibe-gradient-bg` + `holo-spin` + `glow-pink` ring around active stories (inactive = violet border + glass, highlight = acid); CityChip active = `vibe-gradient-bg` + `glow-pink`, inactive = glass + violet border; For You/All tab toggle gets glass shell + glow-pink active; For You banner = `gold-foil` + `glow-violet` with `vibe-gradient-text` "Tuned for your vibe" label and multi-color matched-vibe chips (uses VIBE_COLORS gradient classes); vibeFilter banner = pink glass + `vibe-gradient-text` filter name + cyan Clear link; section headers get neon gradient underline accents (coral→pink→violet / pink→cyan).
- detail-screen.tsx: root div + loading skeleton get `animate-screen-in`; cover overlay switched to `from-background via-violet/40 to-transparent` + a `mix-blend-screen` cyan→pink holo sheen; empty cover fallback uses `vibe-gradient-bg`; back button = glass + `glow-cyan` + cyan border/icon; save button glows pink when active; share button = violet hover; title bumped to `text-3xl` + `vibe-gradient-text`; Who's-Going + House Rules + Host card + Fact cards all converted to `glass` + `border-violet/25`; host avatar wrapped in a layered `vibe-gradient-bg` + `glow-pink` ring; host ShieldCheck = acid; Message host button = `vibe-gradient-bg` + `glow-pink` + active scale; View profile = cyan outline; About / House Rules section headers use `vibe-gradient-text`; house-rules checks = acid; quick-facts icons re-tinted to pink/violet/cyan/sunshine; added a `Get directions` ghost button (cyan outline, opens `https://maps.google.com/?q=LAT,LNG` in new tab) shown only when `party.lat` + `party.lng` are present — pure visual link, no new state; sticky CTA bar upgraded to `glass-strong` + `vibe-gradient-border`; Request-to-Connect button = `vibe-gradient-bg` + `glow-pink` + active scale; fee shown in `text-sunshine`; drawer title + "Send Request 🚀" button also get `text-glow-pink` / `glow-pink`; drawer tips box + textarea use glass + violet/cyan focus.
- create-screen.tsx: imported `VIBE_EMOJI`, `VIBE_COLORS`, `formatDateLabel`, `formatFee`, `formatTime`; root + form get `animate-screen-in`; header back button = glass + cyan border/glow; entire form wrapped in a single `glass-strong` + `vibe-gradient-border` rounded-3xl card with `space-y-6`; every Label converted to `text-cyan` with a small `bg-cyan` neon dot (`glow-cyan`); inputs/selects/textarea all restyled to dark-violet fields (`bg-card/60`, `border-violet/40`) with violet focus rings; cover preview frame wrapped in `vibe-gradient-border` (holo frame) + cyan top sheen + glass preset chip; cover preset thumbnails use `glow-pink` when active; entry-type buttons use `glow-pink` when active; fee input icon tinted sunshine; max-guests slider gradient rewritten with new `#ff2e97`/`#9d4edd` stops + cyan counter chip; vibe-tag multi-select redesigned — selected tags now glow their own color via `VIBE_COLORS[v]` gradient classes + `scale-110` + `glow-pink` + ✓ icon, unselected = glass; new "Live preview" section at the bottom shows a mini party-card mock (cover, fee badge in sunshine, title placeholder, date/time/area line, multi-color vibe chips, host line) reusing the same styling tokens; footer Launch button = `vibe-gradient-bg` + `glow-pink` + `vibe-pulse` when enabled + `disabled:opacity-60`; slider thumb CSS updated to `#ff2e97`.
- Ran `bun run lint` (clean, 0 errors) and `npx tsc --noEmit` (no errors in the 4 edited files; remaining errors are pre-existing in unrelated files: examples/websocket, skills/*, onboarding-screen.tsx).

Stage Summary:
- All 4 primary screens (login, home, detail, create) now use the Gen Z neon palette intentionally multi-color (pink→violet→cyan signature gradient, acid/coral/sunshine accents) instead of the previous monochrome gold/amber look.
- Visual changes only — no screen logic, state, API calls, props, event handlers, navigation, or data flow were modified. Only classNames, decorative wrapper elements, gradient overlays, animation classes, and (in detail-screen) a safe `target=_blank` `<a>` link to Google Maps were added.
- Reused the existing globals.css utility classes (`glass`, `glass-strong`, `vibe-gradient-bg`, `vibe-gradient-bg-warm`, `vibe-gradient-text`, `vibe-gradient-border`, `gold-foil`, `glow-pink`/`-violet`/`-cyan`, `text-glow-pink`/`-cyan`/`-acid`, `vibe-pulse`, `vibe-float`, `aurora-drift`, `holo-spin`, `vibe-live-ring`, `animate-screen-in`) — no new CSS utilities introduced, no new npm deps.
- Multi-color vibe chips powered by the existing `VIBE_COLORS` map (per-vibe neon hue) — used in home For-You banner, create vibe multi-select, and create live-preview card.
- All CTAs across the four screens now share a consistent treatment: `vibe-gradient-bg` (or `vibe-gradient-bg-warm` for the Host CTA) + `glow-pink` + `active:scale-95` press feedback; create-screen submit additionally pulses when enabled.
- Accessibility preserved: 44px+ touch targets maintained (header buttons bumped to h-10 w-10 where they were h-9 w-9), aria-labels on icon buttons, decorative elements marked `aria-hidden`, notification bell uses `role="status"`, directions link uses `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- Files changed: `src/screens/login-screen.tsx`, `src/screens/home-screen.tsx`, `src/screens/detail-screen.tsx`, `src/screens/create-screen.tsx`.
- Verification: `bun run lint` → 0 errors. `npx tsc --noEmit` → no errors in edited files. Dev server untouched on port 3000.

Task ID: 2-c
Agent: frontend-styling-expert (secondary screens)
Task: Restyle inbox, chat, profile, edit-profile, my-parties, requests, saved, onboarding screens to Gen Z neon palette

Work Log:
- Read worklog.md and globals.css to confirm Gen Z palette (pink/violet/cyan/acid/coral/sunshine) + utility class set (.glass, .glass-strong, .gold-foil, .glow-*, .vibe-gradient-bg[-warm|-acid], .vibe-gradient-text, .vibe-gradient-border, .vibe-pulse, .vibe-float, .vibe-live-ring, .holo-spin, .aurora-drift, .animate-screen-in, .animate-pop-in, .vibe-skeleton, .text-glow-*).
- inbox-screen.tsx: root .animate-screen-in; header upgraded to .glass-strong with pink aurora blob behind; "Find" button now glass with cyan hover; thread rows are .glass + .vibe-gradient-border with .press-feedback; unread cards get .glow-pink, others glow-violet on hover; avatars wrapped in vibe-gradient-bg ring; unread count badge keeps numeric info but now .bg-pink + .vibe-live-ring pulse + ring-2 ring-background; timestamps in cyan; loading skeletons use .vibe-skeleton; removed unused MessageCircle import; empty-state CTA gets .glow-pink.
- chat-screen.tsx (preserved ALL socket.io logic — useEffect, socket.on/off, emit, useMutation, invalidateQueries untouched; only classNames + decorative wrappers changed): root .animate-screen-in; header .glass-strong; back button = cyan hover + .glow-cyan; other-user avatar wrapped in vibe-gradient-bg ring; online dot = lime-300 with text-glow-lime and 6px neon shadow; typing state = pink text-glow-pink; phone/video/more buttons each tinted (violet/violet/pink) on hover; intro banner = .glass + .vibe-gradient-border + .vibe-float, avatar in gradient ring; day separators = .glass with cyan text; MINE bubbles = .vibe-gradient-bg + white text + .glow-pink; THEIRS bubbles = .glass dark violet + ring-border/40; reaction-active ring = cyan; typing dots now tri-color (pink/violet/cyan bouncing); composer = .glass-strong; quick replies = .glass + ring + pink hover; emoji picker = .glass-strong; input gets violet focus ring (focus-visible:ring-violet/60 + border-violet/50); send button = .vibe-gradient-bg + .glow-pink (kept active:scale-90). Sheet + Dialog content = .glass-strong; report options = .glass + pink ring when selected; report dialog title uses .vibe-gradient-text. ChatHeaderSkeleton upgraded to .glass-strong + .vibe-skeleton.
- profile-screen.tsx: root .animate-screen-in; header .glass-strong; settings button = violet hover; hero section = .glass-strong + .vibe-gradient-border with full-width vibe-gradient-bg strip across top + dual pink/cyan aurora blobs; avatar wrapped in vibe-gradient-bg ring (replaced component's `ring` prop with manual holo ring for the multi-color effect); username + city in cyan; crown icon now sunshine yellow + text-glow-acid; bio wrapped in a .glass sub-card; "Edit profile" button = .vibe-gradient-bg pill + .glow-pink + active:scale-95. Stat component extended to accept `accent` ("pink"|"violet"|"cyan") + `delay`; stats now 3 .glass-strong tiles each with a different neon ring + .animate-pop-in staggered at 0/60/120ms. Vibe-score card = .glass-strong + .vibe-gradient-border; "Vibe score" eyebrow in cyan; max-tier text = sunshine + text-glow-acid; progress bar gets ring-border/40. Achievements grid uses .glass + .vibe-gradient-border for unlocked items. Activity + Settings sections = .glass-strong + .vibe-gradient-border containers; row icons each use a different neon (coral/pink/cyan/rose-400 for activity; violet/indigo-300/cyan/emerald-400/muted for settings); row icon container gets ring-border/40. Sign-out button = rose-500/10 bg + rose-500/40 ring + rose-300 text, hover deepens.
- edit-profile-screen.tsx: root .animate-screen-in; header .glass-strong; back button = cyan + glow-cyan; title = .vibe-gradient-text; Save button keeps .vibe-gradient-bg + adds .glow-pink. Avatar wrapped in vibe-gradient-bg ring; camera badge = .vibe-gradient-bg + .glow-pink. Avatar preset picker: selected = border-pink + .glow-pink; unselected = opacity-70 + violet hover. All form fields are wrapped in a single .glass-strong + .vibe-gradient-border card. Inputs upgraded to bg-card/60 with violet focus ring (focus-visible:ring-violet/60 + border-violet/50). Username/Instagram @ prefixes now cyan. City <select> gets violet focus ring. Field label component rewritten: now cyan/90 uppercase tracking with a pink neon dot (h-1.5 w-1.5 bg-pink with 6px pink shadow) prefix. Added a Cancel ghost button (.glass + ring-border/40 + rose hover) below the form.
- my-parties-screen.tsx: root .animate-screen-in; header .glass-strong; back button = cyan + glow-cyan; title = .vibe-gradient-text. Skeletons = .glass-strong + .vibe-gradient-border wrappers with .vibe-skeleton. Empty-state CTA = .vibe-gradient-bg + .glow-pink. Parties-hosted counter line = cyan/80. (Did NOT add Live/Upcoming/Past tabs because the existing screen has no such state and adding it would violate the "preserve all functionality" rule; tabs guidance was noted as aspirational.)
- requests-screen.tsx: root .animate-screen-in; header .glass-strong; back button = cyan + glow-cyan; title renamed visually to "Requests" via .vibe-gradient-text (existing "Join requests" wording changed to "Requests" only inside the gradient-text span). Tab strip = .glass + ring-border/40; active tab = .vibe-gradient-bg + .glow-pink; inactive = muted. Skeletons upgraded to .glass-strong + .vibe-skeleton. Request cards = .glass-strong + .vibe-gradient-border; requester avatar wrapped in vibe-gradient-bg ring; timestamp in cyan/80. Accept button = .vibe-gradient-bg-acid + black text + .glow-acid + active:scale-95 (acid green = strong "yes" affordance). Decline button = .glass + rose-300 text + rose-500/40 ring + rose hover. Status badges: accepted = lime-400/15 bg + lime-300 text + lime-400/40 ring; rejected = rose-500/15 bg + rose-300 text + rose-500/40 ring (also a Clock icon for visual texture).
- saved-screen.tsx: root .animate-screen-in; header .glass-strong; back button = cyan + glow-cyan; title = .vibe-gradient-text; subtitle counter in cyan/80; heart icon = fill-pink + text-glow-pink. Skeletons = .glass-strong + .vibe-gradient-border + .vibe-skeleton. Replaced the EmptyState component with a custom celebratory empty state: floating (vibe-float) bookmark emoji 🔖 inside a vibe-gradient-bg-warm tile with glow-pink, a gradient-text "No saved parties yet" headline, supporting copy, and a .vibe-gradient-bg + glow-pink CTA. Removed now-unused EmptyState + Bookmark imports.
- onboarding-screen.tsx (full rewrite — visual only; finish()/toggle()/step state, api.updateUser, setOnboarded, setCityFilter, setScreen, toast.success all preserved exactly): root .animate-screen-in; background upgraded from 2 blobs to 4 .aurora-drift blobs (pink + violet + cyan + acid) for true Gen Z aurora. Progress dots now .vibe-gradient-bg + .glow-pink when active. Step 1 (city): big "Let's set your vibe" headline uses .vibe-gradient-text; MapPin hero tile = .vibe-gradient-bg + .glow-pink. New CITY_COLOR map gives each city a different neon — Delhi=pink, Mumbai=cyan, Bangalore=violet, Goa=coral, Pune=acid/lime. Each city tile = .glass-strong + .vibe-gradient-border + ring-2 in its color + .glow-* + scale-[1.03] when selected; city icon sits in a tinted bg/ring tile; selected check badge = .vibe-gradient-bg. Continue button = .vibe-gradient-bg + .glow-pink + .vibe-pulse (celebratory pulse). Step 2 (vibes): Sparkles hero tile = .vibe-gradient-bg-warm + .glow-pink. New VIBE_COLOR map matches types.ts (Techno=cyan, EDM=pink, Lo-fi=violet, Boardgames=acid, Bollywood=coral, BYOB=sunshine, Chill=sky, Retro=rose). Vibe buttons in 2-col grid; selected = .glass-strong + .vibe-gradient-border + ring-2 in its color + .glow-* + scale-[1.04] + colored blurred aura behind the emoji. Back button = .glass + ring-border/40 + violet hover. Step 3 (done): PartyPopper hero = .vibe-gradient-bg-warm + .glow-pink + .vibe-pulse; "You're all set!" headline = .vibe-gradient-text; picked vibe chips each render in their VIBE_COLOR (tinted bg + ring + text). Enter VibeMatch button = .vibe-gradient-bg + .glow-pink + .vibe-pulse. Removed pre-existing unused useRouter import for hygiene.
- Verification: `bun run lint` → exit 0, 0 warnings, 0 errors. `npx tsc --noEmit` filtered to the 8 touched screen files → 0 errors (after fixing one initial TS error: CITY_COLOR was missing the `bg` field that the city icon tile uses — added `bg` to each entry). Did NOT run `bun run build` per instructions; dev server on :3000 left untouched.

Stage Summary:
- All 8 secondary screens restyled to the Gen Z neon palette. Multi-color, vibrant, glassmorphic, holographic — each screen gets .animate-screen-in, .glass-strong headers, .vibe-gradient-text headlines, .vibe-gradient-bg CTAs with .glow-pink, .vibe-gradient-border on premium cards, multi-color avatar rings (vibe-gradient-bg blur), aurora blobs on the celebratory screens (onboarding has 4 drifting aurora blobs).
- Per-screen intentional multi-color assignments:
  - inbox: pink (unread), cyan (timestamps/Find button), violet (hover glow on read threads).
  - chat: pink (mine bubbles), glass-violet (theirs), lime (online dot), cyan (back/read-checks), violet (input focus), tri-color (pink/violet/cyan) typing dots.
  - profile: 3 stat tiles get pink/violet/cyan accent rings; activity row icons = coral/pink/cyan/rose; settings row icons = violet/indigo/cyan/emerald/muted; sunshine for crown + max-tier.
  - edit-profile: pink neon dots on labels, violet focus rings, cyan @ prefixes, rose cancel hover.
  - requests: acid-green accept pill (vibe-gradient-bg-acid), rose decline, lime accepted badge, rose rejected badge, cyan timestamps.
  - onboarding: 4-color aurora blobs; per-city neon (Delhi=pink/Mumbai=cyan/Bangalore=violet/Goa=coral/Pune=acid); per-vibe neon (8 distinct colors matching types.ts VIBE_COLORS).
- Files changed (8): src/screens/{inbox,chat,profile,edit-profile,my-parties,requests,saved,onboarding}-screen.tsx. No other files touched. No new dependencies. All socket.io / API / state / mutation logic preserved verbatim — only className strings, decorative wrapper spans, gradient overlays, and animation classes were modified.
- Lint clean. TypeScript clean for all 8 files.
- Notes / known limitations:
  1. Did NOT add Live/Upcoming/Past tabs to my-parties-screen — the existing screen has no such state and the critical rules forbid adding state/logic. The tabs guidance is preserved as a future enhancement recommendation.
  2. Did NOT add a separate party-context banner with vibe-float to chat-screen — the existing intro banner already serves that role and got .vibe-float; no separate banner exists in the data model.
  3. The .holo-spin animation is defined in globals.css but was intentionally not used on selected vibe buttons — holo-spin is a 6s infinite 360° rotation which would be visually distracting on selectable chips; instead selected vibes get a static multi-color gradient-border ring + glow + scale + colored blurred aura. If a rotating ring is desired, a slower variant (e.g. 18-24s) would read better.
  4. The profile screen still has a few legacy gradient tier colors (from-slate-400, from-cyan-400, from-violet-400, from-amber-400) baked into the tiers array — these are functional tier indicators, kept untouched to avoid changing logic.

Task ID: 2-a
Agent: frontend-styling-expert (components)
Task: Restyle shared vibe components to Gen Z neon palette

Work Log:
- Read worklog.md (tasks 0 → 2-d context) + globals.css + types.ts (VIBE_COLORS / VIBE_EMOJI Gen Z maps) to confirm utility class set + per-vibe neon hues already defined.
- Read all 8 target components to map structure, props, and existing logic before editing.
- party-card.tsx: Card shell = `glass` + `vibe-gradient-border` (holo edge); hover = `-translate-y-1` + `glow-pink`; live cards get `ring-pink/40` + `glow-pink` + a top `vibe-gradient-bg` accent strip. Added a "featured" holo badge in the top-right corner (rotating `holo-spin` dashed ring + `Flame` icon + pink/cyan/violet blurred aura) shown when the party is live OR guest-fill ≥ 75%. Cover overlay switched to `from-background via-violet/45 to-transparent` + a hover-only `mix-blend-screen` cyan↔pink holo sheen. Empty cover fallback now uses `vibe-gradient-bg`. Slot-left chip = emerald/lime when plenty, amber+glow when low, rose when sold out. Save-heart button = pink glow when saved (`bg-pink/35 border-pink/70`, `fill-pink text-pink text-glow-pink`), glass-violet when unsaved. Fee badge now uses `vibe-gradient-bg-warm` (paid) or `vibe-gradient-bg-acid` (free) with an IndianRupee icon + colored glow shadow. Title gets `group-hover:text-glow-pink`. Metadata icons each use a different neon: MapPin=cyan, Calendar=coral, Clock=sunshine, Users=lime-300. Host row Sparkles icon = pink; footer border-top = `border-violet/20`. All props/logic/handlers (`onOpen`, `onSave`, `useAppStore` saved selectors, `toast`) preserved verbatim.
- vibe-badge.tsx: Added a local `VIBE_GLOW` map (one box-shadow color per vibe family — cyan/coral/amber/lime/violet/sky/pink/rose) so each badge glows in its own hue. Bumped font to `font-semibold`, padding to `px-2.5`, backdrop-blur. Hover (when clickable) = `hover:scale-110 hover:-translate-y-0.5 active:scale-95` for sticker-pack playfulness. Active state now uses `ring-pink/70` + `glow-pink` instead of legacy gold ring. Emoji wrapped in a `text-[1.05em] leading-none` span for tighter rendering. Tag (button vs span) logic preserved.
- bottom-nav.tsx: Glass shell upgraded to `glass-strong` with a 1px `vibe-gradient-bg` neon top edge (pink→violet→cyan). FAB = `vibe-gradient-bg` disc with `ring-4 ring-background`, an outer `holo-spin` dashed white ring, an outer blurred gradient aura, and an inner white-foil highlight; adds `hover:glow-gold-strong`, `active:scale-90 active:vibe-pulse` for press feedback. Plus icon gets a white drop-shadow. NavButton: active text = `text-pink text-glow-pink` with `bg-pink/15` pill + pink glow shadow + a `vibe-gradient-bg` underline indicator (`-bottom-[7px] w-7 h-[3px]`) + a glowing pink dot under the icon; inactive = `text-muted-foreground` with `group-hover:bg-white/5`. All screen-routing logic (`setScreen("home"|"inbox"|"profile")`, `openCreate`, login-hide) untouched.
- live-countdown.tsx: Each status now uses its own distinct neon. `STATUS_STYLES` rewritten: live = pink `bg-pink/25 border-pink/60 text-pink text-glow-pink vibe-live-ring`; starting-soon = coral `bg-orange-500/25 border-orange-400/60 text-orange-200` + orange glow shadow; today = cyan `bg-cyan-500/20 border-cyan-400/55 text-cyan-100` + cyan glow; upcoming = violet `bg-violet-500/20 border-violet-400/55 text-violet-200` + violet glow; past = muted (unchanged). The `vibe-live-ring` pulse now correctly only fires on `status === "live"` (added via `cfg.extra` instead of a separate conditional). Self-updating 30s tick + countdown logic preserved.
- empty-state.tsx: Outer gap bumped to `gap-4`, padding `py-12`. Icon container is now a `vibe-float` animated 80px `glass-strong` + `vibe-gradient-border` + `glow-pink` rounded-3xl tile, surrounded by a layered pink/violet/cyan aura (blurred `vibe-gradient-bg` scales). Icon is `text-pink text-glow-pink` at `h-9 w-9 strokeWidth=2`. Title uses `font-display text-xl vibe-gradient-text`. Description gets `leading-relaxed`. All props (`icon`, `title`, `description`, `action`, `className`) preserved.
- rating-pill.tsx: Pill background `bg-amber-400/10`, border `amber-300/30`, plus an amber glow shadow. Star icon now has a `drop-shadow-[0_0_6px_rgba(255,214,10,0.85)]` for the neon star glow. Rating number text bumped to `text-amber-100 font-semibold`; count stays muted amber. StrokeWidth=2 on the star for crisper rendering.
- guest-avatars.tsx: Added a `RING_COLORS` rotation array (pink → violet → cyan → lime → coral) — each stacked avatar gets a different neon ring color with a matching glow shadow. Avatar base gets `bg-card` so the ring sits cleanly on the dark background. "+N" pill at the end switched from plain `bg-secondary` to `vibe-gradient-bg` (pink→violet→cyan) with black text + pink glow shadow + `ring-2 ring-card`. All overlap math, `size`/`max`/`total` logic, `pickGuestAvatars` consumption preserved.
- user-avatar.tsx: Replaced the simple `ring-2 ring-pink/60` with a full pink→violet→cyan gradient ring built from `vibe-gradient-bg` + `glow-pink` + inner padding (so the gradient shows around the avatar). Inner avatar gets `ring-1 ring-background` to separate it from the gradient. Initials text gets a pink drop-shadow glow. Added an optional lime online-status dot (bottom-right) shown when `ring=true` — a `bg-lime-300` disc with `ring-2 ring-background` + an 8-10px lime glow, sized proportionally to the avatar. No new props added — reuses the existing `ring` boolean. `initials()` helper + `src`/`size`/`className` props all preserved.
- Verified: `bun run lint` → 0 errors, 0 warnings (exit 0). `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors in `src/components/vibe/*` (remaining tsc errors are pre-existing in `examples/websocket` + `skills/*`, untouched). Dev server on port 3000 still returns HTTP 200.

Stage Summary:
- All 8 shared vibe components restyled to the Gen Z neon palette. Each component is now intentionally multi-color (not monochrome pink): party-card uses cyan/coral/sunshine/lime for its 4 metadata icons + a warm-gradient fee badge + a holo featured badge; vibe-badge glows in its own per-vibe hue; bottom-nav active tab uses a tri-color gradient underline + pink glow; live-countdown gives each status a distinct neon (pink/coral/cyan/violet); guest-avatars rotates pink/violet/cyan/lime/coral rings; user-avatar gets a tri-color gradient ring + lime status dot.
- Reused existing globals.css utility classes only (`glass`, `glass-strong`, `vibe-gradient-bg`, `vibe-gradient-bg-warm`, `vibe-gradient-bg-acid`, `vibe-gradient-text`, `vibe-gradient-border`, `glow-pink`, `glow-gold-strong`, `text-glow-pink`, `vibe-pulse`, `vibe-float`, `vibe-live-ring`, `holo-spin`). No new CSS utilities introduced. No new npm dependencies.
- Files changed (8): `src/components/vibe/{party-card,vibe-badge,bottom-nav,live-countdown,empty-state,rating-pill,guest-avatars,user-avatar}.tsx`.
- All component props, function signatures, exports, event handlers, store selectors, toast calls, navigation logic, and self-updating 30s tick were preserved verbatim — only className strings, decorative wrapper spans, gradient overlays, animation classes, and (in party-card) one new decorative Flame import for the featured badge were touched.
- Accessibility preserved: 44px+ touch targets (save button bumped h-8→h-9 w-8→w-9; FAB stays h-16 w-16; nav buttons stay h-9 w-9), aria-labels on save + FAB + nav buttons, `aria-hidden` on all decorative aura/spin/underlines, role="button" + tabIndex + keyboard handler on party-card, aria-current="page" on active nav, role="status" implicit on live-countdown via LiveCountdown. Decorative-only emoji spans marked aria-hidden.
- "Featured" holo badge on party-card uses an existing visual heuristic (isLive OR ≥75% guest-fill) — no new data fields or state, just derived from existing `party.guestCount`/`party.maxGuests`/`isLive`.
- Note on user-avatar online dot: added as a decorative lime accent visible only when `ring=true` (no new prop). Reuses the existing `ring` boolean, so callers that pass `ring={true}` for the host or current user will now see a small lime status dot in the bottom-right corner. This is a visual-only addition; if a future caller wants to opt out, a new optional `online` prop would be needed (left as a future enhancement to keep the props signature unchanged per the critical rules).

Task ID: ORCH- FINAL
Agent: orchestrator (Gen Z palette + map view round)
Task: Switch VibeMatch from black+gold to a Gen Z neon palette ("make it genz pallette color, make it cool, add a map view of the nearby parties") and verify end-to-end.

Work Log:
- Read prior worklog: project was on a black+gold theme with a working map view (gold pins, gold rings). User now requested a Gen Z palette + cool aesthetic + map view (already existed, needed to match the new palette and be cooler).
- Foundation (Task 1, done by orchestrator):
  - Rewrote `src/app/globals.css`: new Gen Z palette — hot magenta `#ff2e97` (--pink, primary), electric purple `#9d4edd` (--violet, secondary), electric cyan `#00f0ff` (--cyan, accent), acid green `#c7ff00` (--acid, pop), coral `#ff6b35` (--coral), sunshine `#ffd60a` (--sunshine). Background `#0a0118` violet-black, foreground `#f8f4ff`, card `#140827`. Body background = 4-stop neon aurora radial gradient (pink TR / cyan BL / violet bottom / acid corner). Re-aliased the legacy `--pink`/`--violet`/`--cyan` tokens (previously all pointing at gold) to the three distinct Gen Z neons so every existing utility (`text-pink`, `bg-violet/30`, `border-cyan/50`, …) auto-transformed. Renamed the custom single-value `--lime` token to `--acid` to avoid clobbering Tailwind's built-in `lime-50…lime-950` scale (which FUN_TIER_META and VIBE_COLORS rely on). Added new utilities: `.vibe-gradient-bg-warm` (sunshine→coral→pink), `.vibe-gradient-bg-acid` (acid→cyan), `.glow-acid`, `.text-glow-pink/cyan/violet/lime/acid`, `.holo-spin` (6s holo rotation), `.aurora-drift` (14s blob drift). Rewrote all fun-tier keyframes (`fun-breathe`→cyan, `fun-pulse`→violet, `fun-bounce`→pink, `fun-lit`→lime+brightness, `fun-sparkle-ring`, `fun-spark`, `here-pulse`) to use Gen Z colors. `vibe-shimmer` / `vibe-skeleton` / `vibe-live-ring` retuned to pink/violet/cyan.
  - Updated `src/lib/types.ts`: `VIBE_COLORS` rewritten so each vibe tag gets its OWN distinct Gen Z neon (Techno=cyan, EDM=pink/fuchsia, Bollywood=coral/orange, BYOB=amber, Boardgames=lime, Lo-fi=violet, Chill=sky/cyan, Retro=rose). `FUN_TIER_META` expanded with 4 new fields (`dotClass`, `textClass`, `chipClass`, `sparkClass`) and recolored per tier: low→cyan, warm→violet, lively→pink, lit→lime+orange-spark.
- Dispatched 4 parallel agents (Tasks 2-a/b/c/d) on non-overlapping file sets, each instructed to preserve all functionality/props and only restyle:
  - 2-a (frontend-styling-expert): 8 shared components in `src/components/vibe/` — party-card (holo featured badge, multi-color metadata icons, warm/acid fee badge), vibe-badge (per-vibe glow map), bottom-nav (tri-color FAB + holo spin + gradient active underline), live-countdown (per-status neon), empty-state, rating-pill, guest-avatars (rotating neon rings), user-avatar (tri-color gradient ring + lime online dot).
  - 2-b (frontend-styling-expert): 4 primary screens — login (aurora blobs, gradient wordmark, cyan OTP slots), home (gradient headline, holo vibe stories, gradient city chips, gold-foil For You banner), detail (holo cover sheen, gradient title, "Get directions" ghost link, gradient CTA), create (glass-strong form, multi-color vibe multi-select, live preview card).
  - 2-c (frontend-styling-expert): 8 secondary screens — inbox, chat (gradient mine-bubbles, tri-color typing dots, preserved all socket.io logic), profile (gradient cover + 3 staggered neon stat tiles), edit-profile, my-parties, requests (acid accept / rose decline), saved (floating bookmark empty state), onboarding (per-city neon, holo vibe grid).
  - 2-d (general-purpose): map-screen full rewrite — rainbow/holo distance rings (cyan/violet/pink/acid), per-tier neon pins (cyan/violet/pink/lime) using the new FUN_TIER_META fields, lit-tier sparkle ring + coral sparks, holo "you are here" marker, tier-gradient tooltip with fun-score bar, dimming (not hiding) of non-live pins when live-only is on, collision-aware pin jitter, shared hover cross-highlight between pins and bottom-sheet rows, aurora map background + dot-grid texture, skeleton loading + empty states.
- Verification (Task 3, done by orchestrator with agent-browser + VLM):
  - `bun run lint` → 0 errors, 0 warnings. `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors in `src/`.
  - agent-browser end-to-end flow at 390×844 (iPhone 14 viewport): open / → login (enter name "Riya", phone "9876543210", send OTP) → read dev OTP "13741" from toast → verify → onboarding (select Delhi → pick Techno/EDM/Chill → "Looks good" → "Enter VibeMatch") → explore feed ("Tonight in Delhi", 2 party cards, "Open vibe map" button) → map (set 25km radius → 2 Delhi pins render: "Retro Cassette Lounge 5.4km Warming up" + "BYOB Garage Sessions Vol. 7 7.0km Warming up") → click pin → detail screen (title, Get directions link, Message host, Reviews, Request to Connect CTA). ZERO console errors / page errors throughout.
  - VLM (glm-4.6v) confirmation of the rendered palette:
    - Login: "vibrant, Gen Z-inspired neon hues (hot pink, electric cyan, neon green) on a dark violet-black background … NOT a gold/amber luxury theme".
    - Explore: "vibrant Gen Z neon palette … multi-color gradients (pink-cyan, orange-pink, purple-pink) … each vibe chip a different neon (Techno=blue, EDM=pink, Chill=cyan) … NOT gold/amber".
    - Map: "distance rings cyan/violet/pink/lime/yellow … party pins tiered colors cyan/violet/pink/lime with glowing effect … + button pink-to-purple gradient … vibrant Gen Z neon on dark".
- Services confirmed running: Next.js dev server on :3000 (HTTP 200), chat socket.io service on :3003 (HTTP 400 = expected for non-handshake GET).

Stage Summary:
- The entire VibeMatch UI has been transformed from black+gold to a cohesive Gen Z neon palette (pink/violet/cyan/acid/coral/sunshine) on a violet-black canvas, with the signature pink→violet→cyan tri-color gradient used as the through-line (wordmark, CTAs, FAB, message bubbles, pin rings, avatar rings).
- The map view — the headline user request — is now cooler and richer: rainbow holo distance rings, per-tier neon animated pins (cyan chill → violet warming → pink lively → lime+coral lit), collision-aware jitter so pins never overlap, dim-not-hide live-only filter, cross-highlighting between map pins and the bottom sheet, tier-gradient fun-score tooltips, and aurora background.
- All 13 screens + 8 shared components restyled. All functionality preserved (auth, OTP, onboarding, CRUD, real-time chat socket.io, proximity API, geolocation, reviews, requests). Lint + tsc clean. End-to-end browser QA passed with zero errors.
- Files changed this round: `src/app/globals.css`, `src/lib/types.ts`, `src/components/vibe/{party-card,vibe-badge,bottom-nav,live-countdown,empty-state,rating-pill,guest-avatars,user-avatar}.tsx`, `src/screens/{login,home,detail,create,inbox,chat,profile,edit-profile,my-parties,requests,saved,onboarding,map}-screen.tsx` (20 files total).

## Unresolved Issues / Risks / Next-Phase Recommendations
- **Fun score is still heuristic** (crowd fill × vibe variety × live bonus × free entry). Next: feed real RSVP velocity + chat message-volume into `funScore` for a genuinely "live" meter.
- **Map projection stays equirectangular** (good for 1–25 km, distorts at country scale). The "India" city-dot falls back to a mid-India coord where the rings are meaningless. Next: hide rings when radius > 50 km, or adopt Leaflet/MapLibre if true pan-zoom is wanted.
- **No geolocation permission-denied UX** — `useMyLocation` silently fails. Next: toast guiding the user to enable location permissions.
- **Saved parties not persisted** — the save heart is UI-only. Next: add a `SavedParty` model + `/api/saved` routes.
- **Public host profile screen** still toasts "Profile coming soon" from the chat header + detail host card.
- **LLM-powered smart quick replies in chat** (use the LLM skill to suggest context-aware replies based on the last message + party context) — flagged since round 1, still open.
- **Notifications screen** — bell badge on bottom nav + a notifications screen (likes, requests, messages, reviews).
- **Message reactions** — add a `Reaction` model + `/api/messages/[id]/react` route + socket relay.

- Ran `bun run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings. Ran `npx tsc --noEmit` — only pre-existing errors in `examples/websocket/server.ts` and `skills/*` directories (unrelated to src/screens/).

Stage Summary:
- 4 primary screens converted to clean Bumble yellow/black: login-screen.tsx, home-screen.tsx, detail-screen.tsx, create-screen.tsx.
- All multi-color neon (pink/cyan/violet/coral/acid/sunshine/lime/amber/emerald/rose) eliminated from these 4 files — verified zero matches via grep for legacy color classes, vibe-gradient-*, holo-spin, aurora-drift, text-glow-*, glow-* (excluding glow-pink which now resolves to subtle yellow shadow), and VIBE_COLORS.
- Single accent palette now: `bg-yellow-400` fills, `text-yellow-400`/`text-yellow-300` text, `border-yellow-400/40`-ish accents, `bg-white/10`/`border-white/10` subtle borders, `glass`/`glass-strong` dark cards on `bg-black`.
- Removed decorative wrappers: 3 aurora blobs + 2 emoji floats + diagonal sheen on login; spinning holo ring wrapper on VibeStory; holo sheen overlay on detail cover; per-vibe VIBE_COLORS gradient lookups on home + create.
- Removed 2 now-unused `VIBE_COLORS` imports (home-screen, create-screen) — keeps the bundle clean.
- InstagramIcon rewritten as a monochrome white SVG glyph (was a 4-stop pink/orange/purple gradient) so it matches the "white icons on glass" social login spec.
- Preserved ALL functionality: state, queries, mutations, handlers, navigation, aria labels, ≥44px tap targets, drawer logic, slider behavior, OTP flow. Only className strings + decorative wrapper spans + unused imports changed.
- Lint: clean. TSC: no new errors in src/screens/.
- Next: another agent should sweep the remaining secondary screens (chat-screen.tsx, map-screen.tsx, profile-screen.tsx, onboarding-screen.tsx) which still contain pink/cyan/violet/lime/amber/emerald/rose classes and vibe-gradient/aurora-drift/holo-spin usages (visible in grep output above). The shared `src/components/vibe/` directory is owned by another agent and should also be checked for neon class residue.

Task ID: 3-a
Agent: frontend-styling-expert (components sweep)
Task: Convert shared components from multi-color neon to Bumble yellow/black

Work Log:
- Read worklog.md (tasks 0 → ORCH-FINAL context) to confirm the project just went gold → Gen Z neon → now Bumble yellow/black (#FFCB05 on #000, white text, single accent).
- Read globals.css to confirm utility-class redefinitions: `vibe-gradient-bg[-warm|-acid]` → solid #FFCB05, `vibe-gradient-text` → solid yellow, `vibe-gradient-border` → solid 1px yellow/55, `.glass` → solid #141414 + white/8 border, `.glass-strong` → solid #0a0a0a + white/10 border, `.glow-*` → subtle yellow box-shadow, `.text-glow-*` → no-op (text-shadow: none), `.holo-spin`/`.aurora-drift` → decorative no-ops. Confirmed `vibe-pulse`, `vibe-float`, `vibe-live-ring`, `animate-pop-in`, `animate-slide-up`, `animate-screen-in`, `vibe-skeleton` are kept functional.
- Read all 10 target components in `src/components/vibe/` to map structure, props, and existing logic before editing.
- party-card.tsx: Replaced the rotating holo "Featured" badge (corner Flame with dashed `holo-spin` ring + blurred `vibe-gradient-bg` aura) with a clean solid `bg-yellow-400 text-black` "Featured" pill (Flame icon kept), moved it INTO the cover's top-left flex column so it no longer overlaps the save heart. Removed the `from-background via-violet/45 to-transparent` cover overlay and the `from-cyan/15 via-transparent to-pink/15 mix-blend-screen` holo sheen (no gradients). Empty cover fallback: `bg-yellow-400/15`. Live accent strip: `bg-yellow-400 animate-pulse`. Slot chip: solid `bg-yellow-400 text-black` (low, urgent) / `bg-yellow-400/15 text-yellow-300 border-yellow-400/40` (plenty) / muted `bg-white/10 text-muted-foreground border-white/15` (sold out — terminal). Save heart: `bg-yellow-400/20 border-yellow-400/60` (saved) / `bg-black/55 border-white/15 hover:border-yellow-400/40` (unsaved); icon `fill-yellow-400 text-yellow-400` when saved (no `text-glow-pink`). Fee badge: single solid `bg-yellow-400 text-black` for both free + paid (removed the acid/warm gradient distinction). Card ring/focus: `ring-yellow-400/40` (live) + `focus-visible:ring-yellow-400/60`. Title hover `text-glow-pink` removed (no-op cleanup). Metadata icons (MapPin/Calendar/Clock/Users) all → `text-yellow-400`. Footer border `border-violet/20` → `border-white/10`. Sparkles host icon `text-pink` → `text-yellow-400`. All props/handlers/store selectors/toast preserved.
- vibe-badge.tsx: Removed the `VIBE_GLOW` per-vibe color map and the `VIBE_COLORS` import (no longer needed). Every vibe now renders as the SAME yellow chip: `bg-yellow-400/15 text-yellow-300 border-yellow-400/45 font-semibold`. Hover (when clickable): `hover:bg-yellow-400/25 hover:-translate-y-0.5 active:scale-95`. Active state: `ring-2 ring-yellow-400 ring-offset-1 ring-offset-background` (was `ring-pink/70 glow-pink`). Removed `backdrop-blur-md` and the old `bg-gradient-to-br` base. Emoji + sizing + Tag (button vs span) logic preserved.
- bottom-nav.tsx: Glass shell top edge `vibe-gradient-bg` → `bg-yellow-400` (solid). FAB: solid `bg-yellow-400` disc with black `+` icon, `ring-4 ring-background`, `hover:scale-105 active:scale-90 active:vibe-pulse`. REMOVED the `holo-spin` dashed ring, the blurred `vibe-gradient-bg` aura, and the inner white-foil gradient highlight (3 wrapper spans gone). NavButton active: `text-yellow-400` + `bg-yellow-400/15` pill (was `text-pink text-glow-pink bg-pink/15` + pink glow). Removed the glowing pink dot under the icon. Replaced the tri-color gradient underline with a single solid `bg-yellow-400` bar (`-bottom-[7px] h-[3px] w-7`). Inactive: `text-muted-foreground hover:text-foreground` with `group-hover:bg-white/5`. All screen-routing logic preserved.
- live-countdown.tsx: Removed per-status color variety (pink/coral/cyan/violet). Rewrote `STATUS_STYLES`: live = `bg-yellow-400/20 border-yellow-400/60 text-yellow-300 vibe-live-ring` (brightest); starting-soon/today/upcoming all = `bg-yellow-400/10 border-yellow-400/40 text-yellow-300/80` (dimmer yellow); past = muted `bg-secondary/40 border-border/40 text-muted-foreground` (unchanged). Self-updating 30s tick + countdown logic + size prop preserved.
- empty-state.tsx: REMOVED the two layered `vibe-gradient-bg` aura wrapper spans (the blurred pink/violet/cyan halos). Icon tile: `glass border-yellow-400/40` + `vibe-float` (kept) + icon in `text-yellow-400` (was `text-pink text-glow-pink`). Title: `font-display text-xl font-semibold text-yellow-400` (was `vibe-gradient-text`). All props (`icon`, `title`, `description`, `action`, `className`) preserved.
- rating-pill.tsx: Pill `bg-amber-400/10 border-amber-300/30` + amber glow shadow → `bg-yellow-400/10 border-yellow-400/30` (no shadow). Star: `fill-amber-300 text-amber-300` + drop-shadow glow → `fill-yellow-400 text-yellow-400` (solid, no glow). Rating number text `text-amber-100` → `text-white`. Count `text-amber-200/55` → `text-muted-foreground`. StrokeWidth=2 preserved.
- guest-avatars.tsx: Removed the rotating `RING_COLORS` array (pink/violet/cyan/lime/coral). All avatar rings now `ring-2 ring-yellow-400/60 ring-offset-1 ring-offset-background bg-card` (uniform). "+N" pill: `vibe-gradient-bg` + pink glow shadow → solid `bg-yellow-400 text-black ring-2 ring-card ring-offset-1 ring-offset-background` (no shadow). All overlap math / `size` / `max` / `total` / `pickGuestAvatars` consumption preserved.
- user-avatar.tsx: Replaced the gradient-ring padding trick (`vibe-gradient-bg glow-pink` outer + gradient-filled inner with `ring-1 ring-background`) with a simple `ring-2 ring-yellow-400` on the outer div. Removed the `padding`/`innerSize` math and the `from-violet/40 to-pink/40` inner bg + `drop-shadow-[0_0_6px_rgba(255,46,151,0.6)]` on initials. Inner avatar fallback bg: `bg-card` (solid). Online dot: `bg-lime-300` + lime glow shadow → `bg-yellow-400` (kept `ring-2 ring-background` border for separation, removed the colored glow boxShadow). `initials()` helper + `src`/`size`/`className`/`ring` props all preserved.
- host-analytics.tsx: Replaced 3 `bg-gradient-to-br from-pink/5 via-violet/5 to-cyan/5` section bgs (empty state, main section, skeleton) with solid `bg-card` + `border-white/10`. Header TrendingUp icon `text-pink` → `text-yellow-400`; `vibe-gradient-text` "Analytics" → `text-yellow-400`. All 4 StatCard icons (Eye/Inbox/CheckCircle/Star) → `text-yellow-400` with `iconBg="bg-yellow-400/10"` (was pink/violet/emerald/amber). Capacity `Users` icon `text-cyan` → `text-yellow-400`; capacity bar fill `vibe-gradient-bg` → `bg-yellow-400`. Top-parties rank badge for #1: `vibe-gradient-bg text-white shadow-[0_0_12px_rgba(236,72,153,0.45)]` → `bg-yellow-400 text-black` (clean). FunnelPill colors rewritten to single-accent yellow with varied opacity: Pending (amber→) `border-yellow-400/30 bg-yellow-400/5 text-yellow-300/80`, Accepted (emerald→) `border-yellow-400/50 bg-yellow-400/15 text-yellow-300` (most prominent — positive outcome), Rejected (rose→) muted grey `border-white/10 bg-white/5 text-muted-foreground` (terminal/negative state). The `color: "amber"|"emerald"|"rose"` prop signature preserved so callers don't break. Skeleton + StatCard + FunnelPill component structure unchanged.
- reviews-section.tsx: All `fill-amber-400 text-amber-400` (summary star, distribution bar star, Stars component stars) → `fill-yellow-400 text-yellow-400` (replace_all). Distribution bar fill `vibe-gradient-bg` → `bg-yellow-400`. "Write a review" button: `vibe-gradient-bg shadow-[0_8px_24px_-8px_rgba(236,72,153,0.6)]` → `bg-yellow-400 text-black hover:bg-yellow-400`. SectionHeading MessageSquare icon `text-pink` → `text-yellow-400`. ReviewItem hover `hover:border-pink/40` → `hover:border-yellow-400/40`. Dialog title `vibe-gradient-text` → `text-yellow-400`. Star selector active: `vibe-gradient-bg border-transparent shadow-[0_6px_20px_-6px_rgba(236,72,153,0.7)]` → `bg-yellow-400 border-transparent`; inactive hover `hover:border-pink/40` → `hover:border-yellow-400/40`. Comment count warning `text-amber-300` → `text-yellow-300`. Submit button `vibe-gradient-bg` → `bg-yellow-400 text-black hover:bg-yellow-400`. All `useQuery`/`useMutation`/`qc.invalidateQueries`/`toast`/`setDialogOpen`/`submitMutation.mutate` logic preserved verbatim.
- Verification: `bun run lint` → exit 0, 0 warnings, 0 errors. `npx tsc --noEmit` filtered to `components/vibe` → 0 errors (remaining tsc errors are pre-existing in `examples/websocket` + `skills/*`, untouched). Dev server on :3000 still returns HTTP 200. Grep audit confirmed NO remaining `vibe-gradient-bg` / `vibe-gradient-text` / `holo-spin` / `aurora-drift` / `text-glow-*` / pink/violet/cyan/amber/lime/emerald/rose/coral/sunshine class usages across all 10 files (only `vibe-gradient-border` on party-card.tsx remains, which is already redefined to solid yellow border per globals.css and is not in the rules' "must replace" list; `glow-pink` also remains on party-card per the rules' "leave them" instruction since it now renders as a subtle yellow shadow).

Stage Summary:
- All 10 shared vibe components converted from Gen Z multi-color neon to Bumble single-accent yellow (#FFCB05) on solid black. Every accent is now yellow; secondary text is white or muted-foreground (#8a8a8a); no gradients; no glassmorphism (kept `.glass`/`.glass-strong` class usages which now render solid); no neon glows (kept `.glow-*` which now render subtle yellow shadow); no decorative animations (removed `holo-spin` rings + blurred auras + `text-glow-*` no-ops).
- Per-component highlights:
  - party-card: featured pill (solid yellow, moved to top-left to avoid heart overlap), single-color fee badge, yellow metadata icons, sold-out/low/plenty chips use yellow with varied opacity + muted grey for terminal.
  - vibe-badge: removed `VIBE_GLOW` + `VIBE_COLORS`; all vibes are the same yellow chip; emoji only differentiates.
  - bottom-nav: FAB is a flat solid yellow disc with black `+`; active tab = yellow text + `bg-yellow-400/15` pill + solid yellow bar underline (no tri-color gradient, no holo ring).
  - live-countdown: all statuses use yellow (varied opacity for live vs starting-soon/today/upcoming); past stays muted grey.
  - empty-state: removed the 2 layered aura spans; clean glass tile with yellow border + yellow icon + yellow title.
  - rating-pill: solid yellow stars, white rating number, muted count.
  - guest-avatars: all rings yellow/60; "+N" pill solid yellow on black.
  - user-avatar: simple `ring-2 ring-yellow-400`; online dot `bg-yellow-400` (not lime).
  - host-analytics: stat icons all yellow; capacity bar yellow; top-party #1 badge solid yellow; FunnelPill uses yellow (pending/accepted) + muted grey (rejected) — preserves the `color` prop signature so callers don't break.
  - reviews-section: all stars yellow; distribution bars yellow; CTA buttons solid yellow on black; dialog title yellow.
- Files changed (10): `src/components/vibe/{party-card,vibe-badge,bottom-nav,live-countdown,empty-state,rating-pill,guest-avatars,user-avatar,host-analytics,reviews-section}.tsx`.
- All component props, function signatures, exports, event handlers, store selectors (`useAppStore` savedPartyIds/toggleSaved/setScreen/openCreate/setSelectedPartyId), toast calls, navigation, useQuery/useMutation/queryKey logic, and the self-updating 30s LiveCountdown tick were preserved verbatim — only className strings + decorative wrapper spans were modified.
- Accessibility preserved: aria-labels on save heart + FAB + nav buttons, aria-current on active nav, role="button" + tabIndex + keyboard handler on party-card, aria-hidden on decorative emoji spans + solid yellow underline bar, ≥44px touch targets (save button h-9 w-9, FAB h-16 w-16, nav buttons h-9 w-9, review star selector h-11 w-11, write-a-review button h-11). Yellow-on-black contrast is high.
- No new npm dependencies. No new CSS utilities introduced. No other files touched.

Task ID: 3-c
Agent: frontend-styling-expert (secondary + map sweep)
Task: Convert inbox, chat, profile, edit-profile, my-parties, requests, saved, onboarding, map screens from multi-color neon to Bumble yellow/black

Work Log:
- Read worklog.md (Task 0 → ORCH-FINAL context), globals.css (confirmed Bumble tokens: --yellow #ffcb05 on --background #000000, --card #141414, aliases pink/violet/cyan/acid/coral/sunshine all → --yellow, .glass / .glass-strong now solid dark cards, .vibe-gradient-bg / -warm / -acid all = solid yellow #ffcb05, .glow-* all = subtle yellow shadow, .text-glow-* = no-op, .holo-spin + .aurora-drift = no-op animations, .vibe-pulse / -float / -live-ring / animate-pop-in / -slide-up / -screen-in / vibe-skeleton + all fun-* map-pin animations KEPT functional and yellow), and types.ts FUN_TIER_META (already monochrome yellow: low/warm/lively/lit all use yellow-400 / yellow-300 shades, varied by ring opacity + glow + size/anim).
- Read all 9 target files end-to-end to map structure (chat-screen.tsx 688 lines with socket.io logic; map-screen.tsx 906 lines with proximity API + collision jitter + dim-not-hide live filter).
- inbox-screen.tsx: removed decorative `bg-pink/25 blur-3xl` header blob; "Messages" eyebrow + "Inbox" title = `text-white/50` + `text-yellow-400 font-display`; Find button = `glass border-white/10` + yellow hover; thread rows = `glass` + unread = `border-yellow-400/50` + read = `border-white/10 hover:border-yellow-400/40`; avatar ring = `ring-2 ring-yellow-400/60`; unread count badge = `bg-yellow-400 text-black vibe-live-ring`; timestamps = `text-white/50`; CTA = `bg-yellow-400 text-black`.
- my-parties-screen.tsx: header `text-yellow-400`, back button `text-white hover:bg-white/10`; skeleton card border `border-white/10`; "{n} parties hosted" `text-yellow-300`; empty CTA `bg-yellow-400 text-black`.
- saved-screen.tsx: header `text-yellow-400` + `text-white/50` subtitle; Heart icon `fill-yellow-400 text-yellow-400`; skeleton `glass border-white/10`; empty-state floating 🔖 in `bg-yellow-400` tile + yellow title + `bg-yellow-400 text-black` CTA.
- edit-profile-screen.tsx: header `text-yellow-400` + Save = `bg-yellow-400 text-black hover:bg-yellow-300`; avatar ring `ring-2 ring-yellow-400`; camera badge `bg-yellow-400 text-black`; avatar preset selected = `border-yellow-400`, hover = `border-yellow-400/50`; form card `glass border border-yellow-400/40`; ALL inputs `bg-card border-white/10 focus-visible:ring-yellow-400/60 focus-visible:border-yellow-400`; Field label = `text-white` with `bg-yellow-400` dot + `shadow-[0_0_6px_rgba(255,203,5,0.8)]`; @ prefix `text-yellow-400/80`; Cancel = `glass text-white/70 ring-1 ring-white/10`.
- requests-screen.tsx: header `text-yellow-400`; tab strip ring `ring-white/10`, active tab `bg-yellow-400 text-black`, inactive `text-white/60 hover:text-white`; requester avatar `ring-2 ring-yellow-400/50`; timestamp `text-white/50`; Accept = `bg-yellow-400 text-black`; Decline = `glass text-white/60 ring-1 ring-white/10 hover:text-white hover:bg-white/5` (REMOVED acid-green + rose); status badges: accepted = `bg-yellow-400 text-black ring-yellow-400`, rejected = `bg-white/5 text-white/40 ring-white/10`.
- profile-screen.tsx: removed per-tier legacy gradient `color` field from `tiers` array (was from-slate-400 / from-cyan-400 / from-violet-400 / from-amber-400-to-pink-500); removed per-achievement `color` field (was cyan/rose/amber/violet/pink/amber-300) — all icons now uniform `text-yellow-400`; hero cover strip = `bg-yellow-400 opacity-30` (removed two `bg-pink/30 blur-3xl` + `bg-cyan/25 blur-3xl` decorative orbs); avatar ring `ring-2 ring-yellow-400`; username `text-yellow-400`; @city line `text-white/70`; Crown icon `text-yellow-400`; Edit profile button `bg-yellow-400 text-black`; 3 Stat tiles now UNIFORM: `glass border-yellow-400/40` + `text-yellow-400` numbers + `text-yellow-400` icons (removed `accent` prop variant entirely); vibe score card = `glass border-white/10`, score number `text-yellow-400`, tier badge `bg-yellow-400` with black icon, "Max tier reached" `text-yellow-400`, progress bar track `bg-white/10` + fill `bg-yellow-400`; section headers `text-white/50`; Trophy icon `text-yellow-400`; unlocked achievement = `border-yellow-400/40` + `bg-yellow-400/10` icon tile; ALL activity + settings row icons = `text-yellow-400` (Flame/Inbox/Calendar/Heart/Bell/Moon/Globe/Shield/HelpCircle); row icon tile = `bg-yellow-400/10 ring-1 ring-yellow-400/30`; Sign out button converted from rose-500 to neutral `border-white/10 bg-white/5 text-white/70 hover:text-white` (rose was on the forbidden list — destructive semantic now implied via neutral styling rather than red); footer 💜 → 💛.
- onboarding-screen.tsx (full rewrite — visual only; finish()/toggle()/step state, api.updateUser, setOnboarded, setCityFilter, setScreen, toast.success all preserved exactly): REMOVED `CITY_COLOR` map (per-city pink/cyan/violet/coral/lime) and `VIBE_COLOR` map (per-vibe neon); REMOVED all 4 `aurora-drift` background blobs → root container is now solid `bg-black`; progress dots active = `bg-yellow-400`, inactive = `bg-white/15`; step-1 city hero tile = `bg-yellow-400` with black MapPin; "Let's set your vibe" headline = `text-white` with `text-yellow-400` "vibe"; ALL city tiles uniform — selected = `border-2 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-400/10`, city icon tile = `bg-yellow-400/15 ring-yellow-400/50` + `text-yellow-400`, name = `text-yellow-400` when selected / `text-white` otherwise, check badge = `bg-yellow-400` with black Check; Continue button = `bg-yellow-400 text-black vibe-pulse`; step-2 vibe hero = `bg-yellow-400` with black Sparkles; ALL vibe buttons uniform — selected = `border-2 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-400/15 text-yellow-300`, unselected = `border border-white/10 bg-white/5 text-white/60 hover:border-yellow-400/40` (REMOVED holo-spin ring + colored blurred aura behind emoji); check badge = `bg-yellow-400` with black Check; Back button = `bg-card ring-1 ring-white/10 hover:ring-yellow-400/40`; "Looks good" = `bg-yellow-400 text-black`; step-3 done hero = `bg-yellow-400 vibe-pulse` with black PartyPopper; "You're all set!" headline = `text-white` with `text-yellow-400` "all set!"; picked vibe chips = `bg-yellow-400/15 text-yellow-300 ring-1 ring-yellow-400/40`; Enter VibeMatch = `bg-yellow-400 text-black vibe-pulse`.
- chat-screen.tsx (SURGICAL — only className strings touched; ALL socket.io logic preserved verbatim: useChatSocket import, `socket.on("chat:message"/"chat:typing")` + cleanup, `socket.emit("chat:typing")` with 1500ms debounce timer, `socket?.emit("chat:message")` in sendMutation.onSuccess, qc.invalidateQueries for thread+threads, react() local-state mutator, onType, send(), confirmReport, confirmBlock, auto-scroll useEffect, groupByDay helper): back arrow `text-white hover:bg-white/10` (was cyan); avatar ring `ring-2 ring-yellow-400/60` (was gradient blur wrapper); name = `text-white`; online/typing status = `text-yellow-400` for both typing + online, `text-white/50` for offline; online dot = `bg-yellow-400` (was `bg-lime-300 shadow-[rgba(199,255,0,...)]`); Call/Video/More buttons = `hover:bg-white/10 hover:text-white` (was violet/pink); intro banner = `glass border border-white/10`, avatar ring `ring-2 ring-yellow-400/60`, safety pill = `bg-yellow-400/15 text-yellow-300 ring-1 ring-yellow-400/30`, Sparkles icon `text-yellow-400`; day label `text-white/50` (was cyan/70); MINE bubbles = `bg-yellow-400 text-black` SOLID (was gradient + glow-pink); THEIRS bubbles = `glass text-white ring-1 ring-white/10`; reaction-active highlight = `ring-2 ring-yellow-400/70`; mine-bubble timestamp = `text-black/60`; read-receipt CheckCheck = `text-yellow-700`; reaction chips = `border-yellow-400/30 bg-yellow-400/10`; reaction picker = `glass-strong ring-1 ring-white/10`; typing dots = all three `bg-yellow-400` (was pink/violet/cyan tri-color); quick-reply chips hover `hover:ring-yellow-400/50 hover:text-yellow-300`; emoji button active `bg-yellow-400/15 text-yellow-300`, hover `hover:bg-white/10 hover:text-white`; input `bg-card border-white/10 focus-visible:ring-yellow-400/60 focus-visible:border-yellow-400`; Send button = `bg-yellow-400 text-black` circle (was gradient + glow-pink); More-sheet SheetContent border `border-white/10`; SheetTitle `text-yellow-400`; report dialog DialogContent border `border-white/10`; DialogTitle `text-white` with `text-yellow-400` name; report reason buttons active = `border-yellow-400 ring-1 ring-yellow-400/50 text-yellow-300` + `text-yellow-400` Check; Submit report = `bg-destructive text-white` (using semantic destructive token, not raw rose-500); SheetButton destructive = `text-destructive`; ChatHeaderSkeleton border `border-white/10`.
- map-screen.tsx (largest set of changes; ALL geolocation, radius filter, city switching, proximity API, pin click → detail, bottom sheet, collision jitter, dim-not-hide live filter, cross-highlight logic PRESERVED — only className + decorative wrapper removal):
  • Replaced `RING_COLORS` rainbow array (cyan/violet/pink/acid rgba) with uniform `rgba(255,203,5,0.30)` stroke + `rgba(255,203,5,0.40)` glow + `bg-yellow-400/15 border-yellow-400/40 text-yellow-300/80` chip — all 4 rings identical.

- Verification: `bun run lint` → exit 0, 0 errors, 0 warnings. `npx tsc --noEmit` filtered to the 9 target screen files → 0 errors. Dev server on port 3000 still returns HTTP 200. Grep sweep across all 9 files for `vibe-gradient-bg|vibe-gradient-text|text-glow|aurora-drift|holo-spin|pink-|cyan-|violet-|lime-|orange-|amber-|rose-|fuchsia|sky-|indigo-|emerald-|from-*|to-*` color classes → 0 matches. Spot-checked chat-screen.tsx socket.io hooks (`socket.on/off/emit`, `useChatSocket`, `sendMutation`, `react`, `onType`, `confirmReport`, `confirmBlock`, `setSheetOpen`, `setReportOpen`, `setShowEmoji`, `setText`, `setIsTyping`, `setReactions`, `setReactingFor`) and map-screen.tsx logic (`geolocation`, `getCurrentPosition`, `setRadius`, `setLiveOnly`, `switchCity`, `useMyLocation`, `api.listPartiesNear`, `projectLatLng`, `haversineKm`, `funScore`, `funTier`, `partyCoords`, `setSelectedPartyId`, `setCityFilter`) — all preserved verbatim. Did NOT run `bun run build` per instructions; dev server on :3000 left untouched.

Stage Summary:
- All 9 secondary + map screens converted from Gen Z multi-color neon to Bumble's simple clean yellow/black palette. Solid yellow `#FFCB05` (Tailwind `yellow-400` fills, `yellow-300` text, `yellow-500` borders) is the ONLY accent color across these files. No pink/cyan/violet/lime/coral/orange/rose/fuchsia/purple/sky/indigo/emerald/amber brand color remains (the destructive red `--destructive #e63946` semantic token is used only for the report-submit + sheet-destructive actions, not as a brand accent).
- Multi-color variety REMOVED in 3 hotspots per spec: (1) profile-screen 3 Stat tiles now uniform `border-yellow-400/40 + text-yellow-400` (was per-stat pink/violet/cyan rings); (2) profile-screen 6 achievement icons now uniform `text-yellow-400` (was per-badge cyan/rose/amber/violet/pink/amber-300); (3) onboarding-screen CITY_COLOR + VIBE_COLOR maps deleted entirely — all city tiles + all vibe buttons use the same yellow selected treatment.
- Decorative animation/utility no-ops REMOVED where they appeared: onboarding 4 `aurora-drift` blobs → solid `bg-black`; map-screen `holo-spin` dashed ring wrapper around "You are here" marker removed; map-screen tri-color holo top accent line + tri-color gradient drag handle on bottom sheet replaced with solid `bg-yellow-400` accent + `bg-white/30` handle; map-screen aurora radial-gradient backdrop (pink/cyan/violet) removed → solid `bg-black` with subtle `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` dot grid.
- Functional animations PRESERVED per spec: `vibe-pulse` (CTAs, hero tiles, scanner chip, live dots), `vibe-float` (empty-state emoji), `vibe-live-ring` (live toggle when active, unread badges), `animate-pop-in` (stat tiles), `animate-slide-up` / `animate-screen-in` (screen + step transitions), `vibe-skeleton` (loading rows), and ALL `fun-*` map-pin animations (fun-breathe / fun-pulse / fun-bounce / fun-lit + fun-sparkle-ring + fun-spark) plus `here-pulse` on the You-are-here marker.
- Party pin SIZE + ANIMATION differentiation kept intact (32px low/fun-breathe → 36px warm/fun-pulse → 40px lively/fun-bounce → 44px lit/fun-lit + sparkle ring + spark particles) — the "fun level" visual is now expressed purely through size + motion + yellow glow intensity, not through color, exactly per the Bumble design rules.
- All socket.io / API / state / mutation logic preserved verbatim across chat-screen.tsx (useChatSocket, socket.on/off/emit, sendMutation, react, onType, debounced typing emit, confirmReport, confirmBlock, groupByDay) and map-screen.tsx (useQuery proximity API, radius + liveOnly state, geolocation, switchCity, projection + collision-jitter, dim-not-hide live filter, pin click → setScreen("detail"), hover cross-highlight).
- Files changed (9): `src/screens/{inbox,chat,profile,edit-profile,my-parties,requests,saved,onboarding,map}-screen.tsx`. No other files touched. No `src/components/vibe/` edits. No new dependencies.
- Lint clean (exit 0). TypeScript clean for all 9 target files. Dev server HTTP 200.
- Accessibility preserved: all `aria-label`s on back buttons / send / emoji / call / video / more / GPS / city dots / party pins / "Use my location" retained; ≥44px touch targets (GPS button h-11 w-11, send button h-10 w-10, radius pills, list rows py-2.5, onboarding Continue h-12); `aria-hidden` on decorative dots / accent bars / drag handle / sparkle rings; `aria-pressed` on radius pills + Live toggle + CityDots; `aria-label` on map pins includes title + distance + tier + live status.
- Notes / known limitations:
  1. Sign out button was previously `border-rose-500/40 bg-rose-500/10 text-rose-300 hover:bg-rose-500/20`. Rose is on the Bumble forbidden-color list, so converted to neutral `border-white/10 bg-white/5 text-white/70 hover:text-white hover:bg-white/10`. If a more clearly-destructive treatment is desired, swap to `bg-destructive/10 text-destructive border-destructive/40` — left as neutral for now since the Bumble spec says "minimal".
  2. Chat-screen Submit-report button + SheetButton destructive still use `bg-destructive` / `text-destructive` (semantic red). These are standard destructive-action semantics, not brand accents, so kept per Tailwind/shadcn conventions. The `--destructive` token is `#e63946` red, distinct from any Bumble-yellow alias.
  3. The map-screen still uses `vibe-gradient-bg`-style fills via the now-solid-yellow `bg-yellow-400` direct class on all pin discs / You-are-here disc / GPS button. No `vibe-gradient-*` utility classes remain in any of the 9 files.
  4. The `RING_COLORS` array is kept as a 4-entry array (all entries identical) so the `RING_COLORS[i]` indexing logic didn't need to change. A future simplification could collapse it to a single constant.
  5. Did not visually test in a running browser (dev server intentionally left untouched per instructions). Recommend the next QA agent verify at 390×844: open map → set 25km radius → confirm uniform yellow rings + yellow pins (varied only by size + animation intensity) + yellow You-are-here disc + solid yellow top accent on bottom sheet; open chat → send a message → confirm yellow mine-bubble (black text) + glass theirs-bubble + yellow typing dots + yellow send button; open profile → confirm 3 uniform yellow stat tiles + yellow tier badge + uniform yellow row icons; open onboarding → confirm uniform yellow city tiles + uniform yellow vibe buttons + no aurora blobs (solid black bg).

Task ID: ORCH- FINAL (Bumble pivot)
Agent: orchestrator
Task: User feedback "it is 3rd class now — make it simple solid yellow and black color like bumble". Pivot the entire VibeMatch UI from the multi-color Gen Z neon palette to a clean, minimal Bumble-style: solid yellow (#FFCB05) on pure black, white text, no gradients, no glassmorphism, no neon glows. Keep the map view but make it monochrome.

Work Log:
- Read prior worklog: the app was on a Gen Z neon palette (pink #ff2e97 / violet #9d4edd / cyan #00f0ff / acid / coral / sunshine) with a richly-animated rainbow map. User rejected it as "3rd class" and asked for Bumble simplicity.
- Foundation (Task 1, orchestrator): full rewrite of `src/app/globals.css`:
  - Single brand accent: Bumble yellow `--yellow: #ffcb05` (+ `--yellow-bright #ffd633`, `--yellow-deep #e0a800`, `--yellow-light #fff0a8`).
  - Re-aliased ALL legacy tokens (`--pink`, `--violet`, `--cyan`, `--acid`, `--coral`, `--sunshine`, `--gold*`) to the yellow family so every existing utility (`text-pink`, `bg-violet/30`, `border-cyan/50`, `bg-gold-foil`, …) auto-renders yellow. One lever, whole-app transform.
  - Background pure black `#000000`, card `#141414`, foreground white `#ffffff`, muted `#8a8a8a`. Body = solid black (removed the 4-stop aurora radial gradient).
  - Redefined ALL utility classes to SIMPLE solid surfaces: `.vibe-gradient-bg`/`-warm`/`-acid` → solid `#ffcb05`; `.vibe-gradient-text` → solid yellow; `.vibe-gradient-border` → solid 1px yellow border; `.glass` → solid `#141414` + white/8 border (NO blur, NO gradient, NO inner glow); `.glass-strong` → solid `#0a0a0a` + white/10 border; `.gold-foil` → pale yellow tint; all `.glow-*` → subtle yellow box-shadow only (no neon); all `.text-glow-*` → `text-shadow: none` (clean).
  - Animations kept minimal & on-brand: `fun-breathe`/`fun-pulse`/`fun-bounce`/`fun-lit`/`fun-sparkle-ring`/`fun-spark`/`here-pulse` retuned to yellow rgba. `vibe-live-ring` yellow. `.holo-spin` and `.aurora-drift` disabled (animation: none) — they're no-ops now so existing usages don't break but add no visual noise. `vibe-shimmer`/`vibe-skeleton` retuned to yellow-on-grey.
- `src/lib/types.ts` (Task 2, orchestrator): `VIBE_COLORS` rewritten so ALL 8 vibes use the same yellow chip (`bg-yellow-400/15 text-yellow-300 border-yellow-400/45`) — no per-vibe color variety. `FUN_TIER_META` rewritten monochrome: all 4 tiers (low/warm/lively/lit) use yellow, varied by OPACITY + INTENSITY (low=yellow/50, warm=yellow/65, lively=yellow/80, lit=solid yellow-300) rather than 4 different neon colors. Pin SIZE + ANIMATION still varies by tier (32/36/40/44px, breathe/pulse/bounce/lit) — that's the "fun level" visual, expressed through motion not color.
- Dispatched 3 parallel sweep agents (Tasks 3-a/b/c) to remove the hardcoded multi-color Tailwind classes that the foundation re-aliasing couldn't catch:
  - 3-a (components): 10 files in `src/components/vibe/` — party-card (removed holo featured badge → solid yellow pill, uniform yellow metadata icons, solid yellow fee badge), vibe-badge (deleted per-vibe VIBE_GLOW map, all vibes same yellow chip), bottom-nav (FAB solid yellow, removed holo-spin ring + tri-color underline → solid yellow bar), live-countdown (all statuses yellow by opacity), empty-state (removed aura layers), rating-pill (yellow stars), guest-avatars (removed RING_COLORS rotation → uniform yellow rings), user-avatar (gradient ring → simple ring-yellow-400, lime dot → yellow), host-analytics (gradient sections → solid card, uniform yellow icons), reviews-section (yellow stars/bars/CTAs).
  - 3-b (primary screens): login (removed aurora blobs + emoji floats → solid black, yellow wordmark, yellow OTP slots), home (yellow headline, removed holo-spin story ring, yellow city chips), detail (removed violet cover overlay + holo sheen, yellow accents, "Get directions" link), create (yellow form accents, uniform yellow vibe multi-select, yellow slider).
  - 3-c (secondary + map): inbox, chat (MINE bubbles solid yellow, typing dots yellow, ALL socket.io logic preserved), profile (removed per-stat pink/violet/cyan variety → uniform yellow), edit-profile, my-parties, requests (acid accept → yellow, rose decline → neutral), saved, onboarding (deleted CITY_COLOR + VIBE_COLOR per-city/per-vibe maps, removed aurora blobs), **map-screen** (rainbow distance rings → uniform yellow dashed rings, aurora map bg → solid black, removed holo-spin wrapper, tri-color top accent → solid yellow; pins stay tier-varied by SIZE+MOTION only, all yellow; collision jitter + dim-not-hide live filter + cross-highlight preserved).
- Orchestrator cleanup: replaced 2 residual `glow-pink` usages in party-card.tsx with `glow-gold` (renders the same subtle yellow shadow). Final grep audit: 0 multi-color classes remaining in `src/screens` + `src/components`.
- Verification (Task 4, orchestrator):
  - `bun run lint` → 0 errors, 0 warnings. `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors in `src/`. Grep audit → 0 residual `pink-*`/`cyan-*`/`violet-*`/`lime-*`/`orange-*`/`amber-*`/`sky-*`/`rose-*`/`fuchsia-*`/`vibe-gradient-bg-warm`/`-acid`/`holo-spin`/`aurora-drift`/`text-glow-*`/`glow-{pink,cyan,violet,acid,lime}` classes in screens+components.
  - agent-browser flow at 390×844: open / → (session persisted, landed on explore "Tonight in Delhi") → open vibe map → set 25km → 2 Delhi pins render ("Retro Cassette Lounge 5.4km Warming up" + "BYOB Garage Sessions Vol. 7 7.0km Warming up") → click pin → detail screen (title, Get directions link, Request to Connect CTA) → Inbox → Profile. ZERO console/page errors throughout.
  - VLM (glm-4.6v) confirmation:
    - Explore/home: "Solid black background, bright yellow accent (matching the Bumble-style yellow aesthetic), white text, NO neon multi-colors."
    - Map: "Distance rings all the same yellow — no rainbow; party pins all yellow; black background; clean minimal Bumble-style yellow-on-black."
    - Detail: "Single solid yellow accent, black background, white text, NOT multi-color neon."
    - Profile: "Clean single-yellow-on-black, NO leftover pink/cyan/violet neon — relies exclusively on black and yellow."
- Services: Next.js dev server on :3000 (HTTP 200), chat socket.io on :3003.

Stage Summary:
- The entire VibeMatch UI has been pivoted from multi-color Gen Z neon to a clean, minimal Bumble aesthetic: **solid yellow (#FFCB05) on pure black, white text, no gradients, no glassmorphism, no neon glows, no decorative holo/aurora effects.** One accent color, expressed boldly.
- The map view is retained and still shows the "fun level" via per-tier SIZE + MOTION (32→44px pins, breathe→lit animations) — but now in monochrome yellow instead of rainbow. Distance rings are uniform yellow dashed circles. "You are here" marker, tooltips, bottom sheet, radius pills, live-only toggle all yellow-on-black.
- All 13 screens + 10 shared components converted. All functionality preserved (auth/OTP, onboarding, CRUD, real-time chat socket.io, proximity API, geolocation, reviews, requests, host analytics). Lint + tsc clean. End-to-end browser QA passed with zero errors. VLM independently confirmed the Bumble palette across 4 screens.
- Files changed this round: `src/app/globals.css`, `src/lib/types.ts`, `src/components/vibe/{party-card,vibe-badge,bottom-nav,live-countdown,empty-state,rating-pill,guest-avatars,user-avatar,host-analytics,reviews-section}.tsx`, `src/screens/{login,home,detail,create,inbox,chat,profile,edit-profile,my-parties,requests,saved,onboarding,map}-screen.tsx` (25 files total).

## Unresolved Issues / Risks / Next-Phase Recommendations
- **Bumble mode is intentionally minimal** — some users may want a touch more visual richness. If feedback asks for "a bit more life," consider: a single subtle yellow radial glow behind the FAB / primary CTAs, or a thin yellow gradient on the cover image overlay. Keep it restrained.
- **Fun-score differentiation is now motion-only** (size + animation). At a glance, all pins look yellow; the tier only reads on closer inspection of size/animation. If users want tier color back, reintroduce a SECOND muted accent (e.g. yellow for low/warm, white for lively/lit) — but that breaks the strict Bumble monochrome. Recommend keeping monochrome and letting size/motion carry the signal.
- **Carryover TODOs from prior rounds** (still open): RSVP persistence for real attendee lists + real fun-score data; public host profile screen; LLM-powered smart quick replies in chat; notifications screen + bell badge; message reactions (`Reaction` model + `/api/messages/[id]/react`); geolocation permission-denied UX toast; saved-parties persistence (`SavedParty` model + `/api/saved`).
- **Map projection** still equirectangular (good for 1–25 km). The "India" city-dot at country scale still renders meaningless rings. Next: hide rings when radius > 50 km, or adopt Leaflet/MapLibre for true pan-zoom.

Task ID: MAP-REALISTIC
Agent: orchestrator (Google Maps realistic round)
Task: Make the map section use realistic Google Maps instead of the custom SVG dot-grid radar background.

Work Log:
- Read prior worklog: VibeMatch map was a custom SVG with concentric yellow dashed rings on a black dot-grid background. User requested "make map section use google maps realistic".
- Investigated embedding options:
  - Google Maps iframe embed (`https://www.google.com/maps?q=...&output=embed`): tested via curl → HTTP 404 + `x-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN`. Google blocks no-API-key embeds from external origins.
  - Google Maps Embed API with key: not available in this sandbox.
  - Decided on **Leaflet + CARTO Voyager tiles** — a free, no-API-key raster tile layer that renders a clean Google-Maps-style basemap (roads, streets, neighborhoods, water, parks, labels) served from Carto's public CDN. Visually closest to Google Maps default style.
- Installed `leaflet@1.9.4` + `@types/leaflet@1.9.21` via `bun add`.
- Rewrote `src/screens/map-screen.tsx`:
  - Added Web Mercator projection helper `latLngToContainerPixel(lat, lng, centerLat, centerLng, zoom)` so overlay pins align EXACTLY with Leaflet's tile grid (replacing the old haversine-based projection).
  - Added `RADIUS_ZOOM` mapping (1km→z15, 2km→z14, 5km→z13, 10km→z12, 25km→z10) so the active radius fills the viewport.
  - Added `CARTO_VOYAGER_URL` + `CARTO_ATTRIBUTION` constants for the tile layer.
  - Leaflet is imported LAZILY inside useEffect (`import("leaflet")`) because Leaflet's runtime touches `window` at module load → would crash Next.js SSR with "ReferenceError: window is not defined". The CSS (`import "leaflet/dist/leaflet.css"`) is SSR-safe and stays at top-level. Type-only import (`import type * as LType from "leaflet"`) gives compile-time types without runtime impact.
  - First useEffect mounts Leaflet ONCE: deferred to `requestAnimationFrame` so the container has its final computed size before Leaflet reads it (without this, Leaflet initializes with size=0 and silently loads no tiles). After `whenReady`, calls `map.invalidateSize()` as a belt-and-braces measure, then `setMapReady(true)`.
  - Second useEffect syncs center/zoom changes: `map.setView(...)` + deferred `map.invalidateSize()` so radius/city/GPS changes correctly re-render tiles for the new viewport.
  - All Leaflet interactions disabled (`dragging: false, scrollWheelZoom: false, doubleClickZoom: false, touchZoom: false, boxZoom: false, keyboard: false`) so the map is a pure visual tile layer — overlay pins stay perfectly aligned with the tile grid.
  - Canvas div changed from `bg-black` to `bg-[#e8eaed]` (matches CARTO's background) + `min-h-[360px]` safety net for flex-1 height propagation.
  - Added subtle yellow brand vignette over the tiles (radial gradient: transparent center → faint yellow edge → darkened corners) — keeps Bumble aesthetic without obscuring map detail.
  - Added "Open Maps" floating button (top-right) linking to `https://www.google.com/maps?q=LAT,LNG&z=ZOOM` so users can open REAL Google Maps in a new tab for pan/zoom/directions.
  - Kept ALL existing overlay UI unchanged: header, radius pills, Live filter, "You" marker with pulse rings, party pins (tier-sized yellow discs with vibe emoji + distance chip + tooltip), loading shimmer, error/empty states, bottom sheet, city switcher.
- Iterative debugging during this round:
  - First attempt used `<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps?q=...&output=embed">` → blocked by Google's SAMEORIGIN frame-options. Pivoted to Leaflet.
  - First Leaflet version had `import * as L from "leaflet"` at top-level → SSR crashed with "window is not defined". Fixed with lazy `import("leaflet")` inside useEffect.
  - Map container had 0 height initially (flex-1 didn't propagate) → added `min-h-[360px]`.
  - Tiles didn't render on first mount (Leaflet read container size before layout settled) → deferred init to `requestAnimationFrame` + `invalidateSize()` after `whenReady`.
  - City switch didn't load new tiles → added `invalidateSize()` after `setView` in the center-change effect.
- Verification (agent-browser + VLM glm-4.6v):
  - `bun run lint` → 0 errors, 0 warnings. `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors in `src/`.
  - Fresh browser session: login → OTP 43874 → onboarding (Delhi + Techno/BYOB/Retro) → "Tonight in Delhi" → tap map icon → map screen.
  - At 5km radius: realistic CARTO Voyager map renders with roads (yellow lines), neighborhoods (beige blocks), water (light blue), "DELHI" map label, "Leaflet © OpenStreetMap © CARTO" attribution. "No parties nearby" empty-state overlay shows (correct — Delhi parties are 5.4km+ away).
  - At 25km radius: 2 yellow pins render on the realistic map — 📼 Retro Cassette Lounge (5.4km) and 🍾 BYOB Garage Sessions Vol. 7 (7.0km). Yellow "You" marker visible in center with pulse rings. Surrounding city labels visible: Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida, Gurgaon, Greater Noida, Ahadurgarh.
  - City switch to Mumbai: header updates to "within 5km of Mumbai", map re-centers and renders Mumbai tiles with "MUMBAI" label, water (Arabian Sea visible). Yellow "You" marker in center.
  - Pin click → navigates to party detail screen ("Retro Cassette Lounge" with host info, attendance, "Get directions" button). 
  - "Open Maps" link href correctly set to `https://www.google.com/maps?q=28.613900,77.209000&z=10` (opens real Google Maps in new tab).
  - No console errors, no runtime errors, no hydration mismatches.

Stage Summary:
- The VibeMatch map section now uses a **realistic Google-Maps-style basemap** via Leaflet + CARTO Voyager tiles (free, no API key). Users see actual roads, streets, neighborhood blocks, water, parks, and city labels instead of the previous custom SVG dot-grid radar.
- All Bumble-style yellow overlay UI is preserved: tier-sized party pins with vibe emojis, "You are here" pulse marker, distance chips, hover tooltips, radius pills, Live filter, bottom sheet, city switcher.
- Added an "Open Maps" button that opens REAL Google Maps in a new tab at the same center+zoom, so users can pan/zoom/get-directions on actual Google Maps.
- Pin positioning uses true Web Mercator projection → overlay pins align pixel-perfectly with the underlying tile grid (a party at 5.4km appears at the correct street in Delhi, not just "somewhere on the canvas").
- Files changed: `src/screens/map-screen.tsx` (full rewrite of the map canvas section). New dependency: `leaflet@1.9.4` + `@types/leaflet@1.9.21`.
- Services: Next.js dev server on :3000 (HTTP 200, clean compile), chat socket.io on :3003.

## Unresolved Issues / Risks / Next-Phase Recommendations
- **CARTO Voyager rate limits**: The free CARTO tile endpoint has generous but not unlimited rate limits. For production scale, consider: (a) signing up for a free CARTO API key for higher limits, (b) falling back to OSM Standard tiles (`https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`) on CARTO failure, or (c) self-hosting a tile server. Current setup is fine for dev/demo.
- **Map is non-interactive** (dragging/zoom disabled) to keep overlay pins aligned with the tile grid. If users want pan/zoom, the "Open Maps" button opens real Google Maps in a new tab. If in-app interactivity is needed later, switch to react-leaflet with native L.circleMarker/L.divIcon pins (loses our rich React tier animations) OR sync overlay pins to map move events (complex).
- **Tile loading flash**: On slow connections, the brief `bg-[#e8eaed]` placeholder shows before tiles render. Could add a skeleton shimmer pattern matching the map style.
- **Carryover TODOs from prior rounds** (still open): RSVP persistence, public host profile, LLM smart quick replies, notifications screen, message reactions, saved-parties persistence.

Task ID: 5
Agent: orchestrator
Task: "Upload into the repo" — finalize git hygiene, persist latest seeded DB, and verify the realistic Google Maps-style map renders end-to-end.

Work Log:
- Reviewed git state: Bumble yellow+black theme (commit e360144) and the realistic Google Maps-style map screen (commit 15b9596 — Leaflet + CARTO Voyager tiles + "Open in Google Maps" deeplink) were already committed. Only db/custom.db (new seeded data + user activity) and scratch output files were uncommitted.
- Updated .gitignore to exclude /tool-results/, /screenshots/, /download/ (agent scratch output, not source).
- `git rm -r --cached` the previously-committed scratch files (kept on disk) so the repo only tracks real source.
- Committed everything as `aaf2157 chore: clean repo hygiene + persist latest seeded DB` (43 files changed: +6 / -9953 deletions of scratch files, + db/custom.db binary, + .gitignore). Working tree now clean.
- Verified dev server healthy on port 3000 (200 responses, no runtime errors in dev.log).
- agent-browser verification (390×844 mobile):
  • App already logged in → Home "Tonight in Delhi" renders with party cards + stories vibe carousel. ✓
  • Tapped "Open vibe map" → Map screen renders with radius chips (1/2/5/10/25km), Live filter, "Use my location", "Open in Google Maps (full interactive view)" link, city selector (India/Delhi/Mumbai/Bangalore/Goa/Pune). ✓
  • Selected Delhi + 25km radius → 2 party pins render ("Retro Cassette Lounge — 5.4km — Warming up", "BYOB Garage Sessions Vol. 7 — 7.0km — Warming up") + matching "Nearby parties" list. ✓
  • Zero console errors, zero page errors. ✓
- VLM (glm-4.6v) analysis of the map screenshot confirmed: (1) realistic street/road map in Google Maps style with roads + labels (Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida) + water; (2) party pins/markers present; (3) "Open Maps" button visible; (4) no errors or blank areas.

Stage Summary:
- Repo is clean and fully committed (HEAD = aaf2157). All prior work — Bumble yellow+black theme + realistic Google Maps-style map — is in the repo and verified working end-to-end in the browser. Ready for the recurring webDevReview cron to continue iterating.

Unresolved / Next-phase recommendations (carried forward):
- Reactions + saved parties are still client-side only → persist server-side (SavedParty table, reactions table + socket relay).
- LLM-powered context-aware chat quick replies.
- "For You" personalized feed ranking using onboarding vibes.
- Host analytics is read-only → add accept/decline actions inline.
- Map pin collision handling for dense cities (5+ parties).

Task ID: ANALYZE-1
Agent: general-purpose (analysis)
Task: Analyze vibematch_app_flow.html design spec and extract required changes.

Work Log:
- Read /home/z/my-project/worklog.md (828 lines) — confirmed current project state: Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui + Prisma (SQLite), single `/` route with Zustand screen state. Current theme = Bumble pivot (Task ORCH-FINAL): solid yellow #FFCB05 on pure black #000000, white text, NO gradients/glass/neon, all legacy tokens (pink/violet/cyan/acid/coral/sunshine/gold*) re-aliased to yellow. Realistic Google-Maps-style map (Leaflet + CARTO Voyager) on Task MAP-REALISTIC. 13 screens exist: chat, create, detail, edit-profile, home, inbox, login, map, my-parties, onboarding, profile, requests, saved. 10 vibe components: app-shell, bottom-nav, empty-state, guest-avatars, host-analytics, live-countdown, party-card, rating-pill, reviews-section, user-avatar, vibe-badge. Cities = Delhi/Mumbai/Bangalore/Goa/Pune (India). VibeTags = Techno/Bollywood/BYOB/Boardgames/Lo-fi/Chill/EDM/Retro. Repo HEAD = aaf2157, clean.
- Read entire /home/z/my-project/upload/vibematch_app_flow.html (956 lines) — 4 sequential Read calls (1-300, 300-649, 650-end). Confirmed: 11 slides total (s0 title, s1-s9 functional steps, s10 close). Phone mockup width 220px (mini UI). :root block at lines 10-19. All `.m-*` class definitions at lines 92-157. Info-panel patterns at 159-172. Verified exact CSS values, exact text copy, exact color hexes.

Key Findings:
- Spec palette is CONFIRMED multi-color (purple #534AB7 dominant + teal/amber/coral/green accents) on near-black #09080f — fundamentally incompatible with current Bumble monochrome yellow. Cannot be achieved by re-aliasing tokens; requires real multi-color palette restoration.
- Spec locale is UK (£ + Edinburgh/Leith/Newington/Marchmont) — fundamentally different from current India cities (₹ implicit + Delhi/Mumbai/Bangalore/Goa/Pune).
- Spec defines 9 functional steps, of which 7 require NET-NEW SCREENS (filter, payment+drinks, confirmation, countdown+location, QR check-in, host dashboard, admin controls). Only 2 map to existing screens (home→Discover, detail→Party detail).
- Spec implies 4 backend capabilities that do NOT currently exist in the Prisma schema or API: (1) Stripe payments + auto-refund, (2) per-party Menu/Drink items with prices + qty pre-order, (3) QR code generation (per-join) + host scan, (4) scheduled push notifications (24hr/2hr before party) + scheduled location-drop at 6PM day-of.
- Spec's bottom nav replaces the current "Map" tab with a "Tickets 🎫" tab (because QR check-in lives in Tickets). Inbox gets a small coral dot badge (#D85A30) instead of a count.
- The spec's mini "m-*" components are scaled-down PHONE MOCKUP renderings (7-9px fonts, 220px wide phones) — these are NOT the real app typography. The real app typography is the info-panel scale: Syne headings (clamp 24-68px), Inter body (14-17px), eyebrow 10px uppercase with line decoration.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) COLOR PALETTE / THEME  (HTML lines 10-19, exact from :root)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Brand / accent tokens (the 5-color semantic system):
  --purple   : #534AB7   ← PRIMARY brand (CTAs, active states, logo "Match", pills, FAB)
  --purple-l : #EEEDFE   ← pale lavender (text on purple surfaces, "me" bubble text)
  --purple-d : #26215C   ← deep purple (unused directly in markup, available for hover)
  --teal     : #1D9E75   ← SUCCESS / verified / approve / "going" / earnings
  --teal-l   : #E1F5EE
  --amber    : #EF9F27   ← UPSELL / menu tags / pending / warning
  --amber-l  : #FAEEDA
  --coral    : #D85A30   ← URGENCY / location drop / "2 left!" / inbox badge
  --coral-l  : #FAECE7
  --green    : #639922   ← alt success (defined but lightly used)
  --green-l  : #EAF3DE

Background + text tokens (near-black, purple-tinted):
  --bg       : #09080f   ← page background (NOT pure black — slight purple tint)
  --bg2      : #110f1f   ← secondary bg / cards / big-step / stat-pill / feature-row
  --bg3      : #18152e   ← tertiary bg (deepest layer, available)
  --border   : rgba(83,74,183,0.2)   ← purple-tinted border token
  --text     : #f0eeff   ← near-white with subtle purple tint
  --muted    : rgba(240,238,255,0.55)
  --dim      : rgba(240,238,255,0.25)

Additional colors used INLINE in markup (NOT in :root but consistent throughout):
  #7F77DD    ← lighter purple (active nav item, active toggle, inline price text, avatar bg)
  #AFA9EC    ← pale lavender-purple (active tab text, step-badge text, location-card title, hero accent text)
  #5DCAA5    ← bright teal (verified check, approve badge, "You're in" success text, prep-list profit)
  #FAC775    ← warm amber (menu tag text, pending stat, amber-tinted avatars, pre-order pill chips)
  #F0997B    ← light coral (location-drop alert title, "2 left!" spots pill)
  #F09595    ← light red (decline/remove badge text, auto-refund notice)
  #0e0c1c    ← phone frame bg (between bg2 and bg3, has purple tint)
  #08070f    ← phone topbar/nav/search bg (darker than page bg, near-black)
  Hero backgrounds per vibe (used as inline `background` on .m-card-img / .m-hero):
    #1a1035  ← R&B night (deep purple)
    #0d1f2d  ← Games night (deep teal)
    #1a2410  ← Bollywood night (deep green)
  Card surfaces: rgba(255,255,255,0.04) with border rgba(83,74,183,0.2-0.35)
  Purple-tinted card surface: rgba(83,74,183,0.1) (chat preview card, location card)
  Coral-tinted alert: rgba(216,90,48,0.1) + border rgba(216,90,48,0.3)
  Amber-tinted alert: rgba(239,159,39,0.1) + border rgba(239,159,39,0.25)
  Teal-tinted alert: rgba(29,158,117,0.1) + border rgba(29,158,117,0.2-0.3)
  Red-tinted alert: rgba(163,45,45,0.12) + border rgba(163,45,45,0.3) (remove-guest card)

✅ CONFIRMED: Spec uses a purple-dominant multi-color palette on near-black #09080f. NOT the current yellow+black Bumble theme. Restoration of multi-color theming (un-aliasing --pink/--violet/--cyan/etc.) is REQUIRED.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) TYPOGRAPHY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Fonts (Google Fonts, line 7):
  Syne   : weights 400;500;600;700;800  ← display/headings/logo/numbers
  Inter  : weights 300;400;500          ← body text

Real-app type scale (info-panel side of each slide):
  .eyebrow : 10px, letter-spacing 0.15em, UPPERCASE, color --purple, weight 500
             decorated with ::before pseudo (20px wide 1px line in --purple)
  h1       : Syne, clamp(36px, 6vw, 68px), weight 800, line-height 1.0
             supports <span class="acc"> for --purple accent words
  h2       : Syne, clamp(24px, 4vw, 42px), weight 700, line-height 1.1  ← slide titles
  h3       : Syne, 18px, weight 600
  .lead    : 17px, color --muted, line-height 1.7
  .body    : 14px, color --muted, line-height 1.7
  .logo    : Syne, 17px, weight 800; "Match" half in --purple

Phone-mockup mini typography (these are scaled-down renderings inside 220px phones — DO NOT use as real app type):
  .m-logo: Syne 12px/800  | .m-card-row: 9px/500  | .m-section: 8px/500
  .m-search/tab: 7-8px     | .m-card-meta: 7px     | .m-meta-item: 7px
  .m-tag: 6px              | .m-pill: 7px          | .m-cta: 8px/500
  .m-stat-val: Syne 13px/700 | .m-stat-label: 6px
  Phone status bar: 9px, color rgba(255,255,255,0.3)

5) SPECIFIC DESIGN TOKENS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Gradients:
  - Title-slide radial glow: radial-gradient(ellipse 50% 60% at 80% 50%,
        rgba(83,74,183,0.1) 0%, transparent 70%)  ← subtle purple aura
  - Grid background texture: 50x50px purple grid via two linear-gradients at 0.03 opacity
  - Scan CTA gradient: linear-gradient(135deg,
        rgba(83,74,183,0.8) 0%, rgba(29,158,117,0.6) 100%)  ← purple → teal
  - No other gradients — design is predominantly SOLID color blocks with opacity layering.

Border-radius values (consistent scale):
  Phone frame: 32px
  Big-step cards (closing): 12px
  m-card (party feed): 9px
  m-cta / m-input: 7px (CTA) / 10px (input — slightly larger for chat)
  m-pill / m-tag / m-badge: 8px (some 5-6px for tighter badges)
  m-meta-item / m-stat / m-menu card: 4-6px
  m-qr-area: 6px
  m-toggle: 6px (pill shape, 22x12)
  Pills in info-panel (step-badge, stat-pill, tag): 100px (full round)
  Avatars / FAB / quantity buttons / step dots: 50% (round)

Shadows:
  - NONE explicitly defined in CSS. Design relies on:
    (a) Border-only separation (0.5px-1.5px purple-tinted borders)
    (b) Background opacity layering (rgba white/4-12 + rgba purple/10-30 + rgba teal/12 etc.)
    (c) Subtle color contrast
  - The existing app's glow-* utilities would need to be re-tuned to subtle purple/teal shadows.

Glass effects:
  - Top slideshow nav IS glass: background rgba(9,8,15,0.9) + backdrop-filter blur(16px)
  - Phone mockup topbar is NOT glass: solid #08070f
  - Phone cards are NOT glass: solid rgba(255,255,255,0.04) (no blur)
  - Recommendation: app's glass utility should be subtle (low-opacity bg + slight blur + purple-tinted border)

Spacing:
  - Slide outer padding: 80px 32px 40px
  - slide-inner: max-width 1000px, gap 60px (phone ↔ info-panel)
  - Phone content padding: 10px
  - Card body padding: 6px 8px
  - Section margin-bottom: 6-7px (tight)
  - Tag/pill gap: 3-4px
  - Grid gap: 3-5px
  - Feature-row padding: 12px (info-panel)
  - Tag-row gap: 7px (info-panel)

Phone frame specs:
  Width: 220px (180px on mobile breakpoint at 700px)
  Border: 1.5px solid rgba(83,74,183,0.35)
  Background: #0e0c1c (purple-tinted near-black)
  Border-radius: 32px
  Animation: float 4s ease-in-out infinite (translateY -10px at 50%, with delay variants d1/d2/d3)
  Status bar: bg #08070f, padding 9px 14px 7px, 9px font, color rgba(255,255,255,0.3)
              Content: "9:41" + "▲ ■"

Animations:
  float:      4s ease-in-out infinite, translateY 0 → -10px → 0
  fade-up:    0.65s ease, opacity 0 + translateY 32px → 1 + 0
              with delay-1/2/3/4 (0.1s / 0.2s / 0.3s / 0.4s)
  ndot scale: 0.3s transition
  progress:   0.2s width transition

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6) KEY DIFFERENCES FROM CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

(A) THEME COLOR SWAP — CRITICAL
  CURRENT (Bumble pivot, Task ORCH-FINAL):
    - Single brand yellow #FFCB05 on pure black #000000
    - White text #ffffff, card #141414, muted #8a8a8a
    - ALL legacy tokens (--pink/--violet/--cyan/--acid/--coral/--sunshine/--gold*)
      re-aliased to point to #FFCB05 → effectively monochrome
    - NO gradients, NO glass blur, NO neon glows (utilities redefined to solid yellow)
    - VIBE_COLORS all 8 vibes use the same yellow chip
    - FUN_TIER_META all 4 tiers use yellow, varied by opacity only
  SPEC:
    - Purple #534AB7 dominant + teal #1D9E75 + amber #EF9F27 + coral #D85A30 + green #639922
    - Near-black #09080f bg (purple-tinted, NOT pure black)
    - --text #f0eeff (purple-tinted white), card bg #110f1f
    - Purple-tinted borders rgba(83,74,183,0.2-0.35)
    - SEMANTIC multi-color: teal=success, amber=upsell, coral=urgency, purple=brand
    - Gradients present (scan CTA purple→teal, title-slide radial purple glow)
    - Glass on top nav (blur 16px)
  ACTION: Restore multi-color theming — un-alias --pink/--violet/--cyan/etc. OR redefine them
  to the spec's palette. Rewrite VIBE_COLORS with per-vibe distinct colors. Rewrite FUN_TIER_META
  with multi-color tiers (or accept monochrome pins on map). Re-enable subtle gradients/glass.

(B) CURRENCY + LOCALE SWAP — CRITICAL
  CURRENT:
    - CITIES = ["Delhi", "Mumbai", "Bangalore", "Goa", "Pune"]  (India only)
    - Currency: ₹ implicit (or none shown)
    - Areas: India city names
    - VibeTags = Techno/Bollywood/BYOB/Boardgames/Lo-fi/Chill/EDM/Retro
    - Party titles like "Retro Cassette Lounge", "BYOB Garage Sessions Vol. 7"
    - Host names: Indian-context
  SPEC:
    - Cities: Edinburgh (primary) + London + Manchester (UK)
    - Areas: Leith, Newington, Marchmont (Edinburgh neighborhoods)
    - Currency: £ throughout (£7 entry, £2 shot, £15 total, £55 net profit)
    - Vibe themes: "R&B night", "Games night", "Bollywood" (more music-genre focused)
    - Host names: Aaditya, Priya, Raj, Sam W., Jamie T., Maya K. (UK student context, Indian-origin)
    - Drinks: "Jack Daniels shot", "Small Norfolk can", "Nachos plate", "Soft drink"
  ACTION: Update CITIES, seed data, all hardcoded copy. Add `currency` config (default "£").
  Note: Spec info-panel slide 2 says "Works across UK and India from day one" — multi-region
  by design. Could keep both India + UK city lists.

(C) NEW SCREENS REQUIRED — MAJOR
  Spec defines 9 functional steps. Current app has 13 screens. Mapping:

  SPEC STEP                          → CURRENT EQUIVALENT        → ACTION
  ─────────────────────────────────  ─────────────────────────  ────────────────────
  1. Discover feed                   → home-screen.tsx          → REDESIGN (new card style, 2 tabs, m-pill theme+spots, search bar, "Happening near you · N vibes" header)
  2. Filter                          → (inline in home)         → NEW SCREEN (profession pills, price slider, city picker, date filter, "Show N matching parties" CTA)
  3. Party detail                    → detail-screen.tsx        → MAJOR REDESIGN (hero with pills + back/share, meta grid 2x2, host verified badge, guest initials locked, menu preview, "Join for £N" CTA)
  4. Payment + drinks checkout       → (none)                   → ENTIRELY NEW SCREEN (cinema layout, qty steppers, payment radios, live total, Stripe CTA, skip-drinks link)
  5. Confirmation + chat unlocked    → (toast only)             → ENTIRELY NEW SCREEN (success banner + receipt + QR + chat preview combined)
  6. Countdown + location drop       → (none)                   → ENTIRELY NEW SCREEN (vertical step tracker, location-drop countdown, mini map card, chat preview)
  7. QR check-in                     → (none)                   → ENTIRELY NEW SCREEN (big QR, pre-order chips, guest-list confirmation, scan CTA)
  8. Host dashboard                  → host-analytics.tsx       → NEW FULL SCREEN (currently just a component; needs stat grid 2x2, guest list with pre-order badges, prep list, earnings, scan CTA)
  9. Admin controls                  → requests-screen.tsx      → ENTIRELY NEW SCREEN (pending approve/decline, confirmed remove, party control toggles, guest cap stepper, auto-refund remove card)

  7 NET-NEW SCREENS required + 2 major redesigns.

(D) REMOVED / CHANGED SCREENS
  Spec does NOT show these current screens:
    - login-screen.tsx      (spec assumes logged-in user; though OTP login can stay)
    - onboarding-screen.tsx (spec has no onboarding flow shown)
    - profile-screen.tsx    (Profile is in bottom nav but no slide shows it)
    - edit-profile-screen.tsx
    - my-parties-screen.tsx (consolidated into Host Dashboard?)
    - saved-screen.tsx
    - map-screen.tsx        (spec has only a small embedded "Leith, Edinburgh · Exact address arriving soon" card on slide 6 — NO full map view)
    - create-screen.tsx     (only FAB in bottom nav, no slide)
  The current Leaflet + CARTO realistic map (Task MAP-REALISTIC) would be DEMOTED
  to an embedded mini-map card on the Countdown screen, NOT a standalone screen.
  This is a notable reduction in map prominence.

(E) NEW FLOW STEPS / CAPABILITIES (BACKEND)
  The spec implies 4 backend capabilities that DO NOT currently exist:
    1. Stripe payments + auto-refund:
       - "Secured by Stripe · refundable if host cancels"
       - "Full refund sent automatically" (on guest removal)
       - Payment methods: Visa / Apple Pay / Google Pay
       - REQUIRES: PaymentIntent model, Stripe SDK integration, refund endpoint
    2. Per-party Menu / Drink items with prices + qty pre-order:
       - "Menu preview" on detail screen
       - Pre-order flow on payment screen with qty steppers
       - Prep list auto-aggregation on host dashboard
       - REQUIRES: MenuItem model (partyId, name, price, emoji), OrderItem model
    3. QR code generation + host scan:
       - QR appears on confirmation screen
       - QR shown on tickets screen
       - Host scans via "Scan guests in ▦" CTA
       - REQUIRES: Ticket model (with unique QR hash), QR generation lib, scanner UI
    4. Scheduled push notifications + scheduled location-drop:
       - "24hr + 2hr push notifications"
       - "Map pin will appear in your group chat at 6PM" (auto-drop)
       - REQUIRES: Notification scheduling (cron or queue), location-reveal cron,
         PushNotification model, web-push or FCM integration

(F) BOTTOM NAV CHANGE
  CURRENT: Explore | Map | Create (FAB) | Inbox | Profile
  SPEC:    Explore | Inbox (coral dot badge) | FAB+ | Tickets 🎫 | Profile
  - "Map" tab REMOVED → replaced by "Tickets 🎫" tab (QR check-in lives there)
  - Inbox moves to position 2 (currently position 4)
  - Inbox badge: small coral dot #D85A30 (not a count number)

(G) DATA MODEL IMPLICATIONS (Prisma)
  Current schema: Party, JoinRequest, User, ChatThread, Message
  Spec would need additions:
    - MenuItem (partyId, name, price, emoji, category)
    - Order / OrderItem (userId, partyId, items[], totalAmount, stripePaymentId, status)
    - Ticket (orderId, userId, partyId, qrCodeHash, scannedAt, scannedById)
    - Notification (userId, partyId, type, scheduledFor, sentAt)
    - Party.approvalRequired (boolean), Party.menuOpen (boolean), Party.acceptJoiners (boolean)
    - Party.locationRevealAt (datetime, default = party date - 3 hours)
    - User.profession (enum: student / software_eng / designer / healthcare / finance / other)
    - Party.themes (rename of vibes? or new field for "R&B night" / "Games night" / "Bollywood")

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7) IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY (ranked by impact)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

═══ P0 — MUST change to match spec (blocking) ═══
  P0.1  Theme color swap in globals.css : un-alias --pink/--violet/--cyan/--acid/--coral/--sunshine
        to spec palette. --purple #534AB7 primary. Bg #000000 → #09080f. Card #141414 → #110f1f.
        Restore --border to rgba(83,74,183,0.2). Restore subtle gradients + glass blur.
  P0.2  Rewrite VIBE_COLORS in src/lib/types.ts with per-vibe distinct colors from spec palette
        (e.g. R&B → purple, Games → teal, Bollywood → amber/coral, etc.)
  P0.3  Rewrite FUN_TIER_META in src/lib/types.ts (either multi-color or accept monochrome purple pins)
  P0.4  Currency + locale swap: update CITIES to include Edinburgh/London/Manchester. Add `currency`
        config defaulting to "£". Update seed data with UK areas (Leith, Newington, Marchmont)
        and £-denominated fees. Update party titles to match spec ("Aaditya's flat party" etc.).
  P0.5  Update bottom nav: remove Map tab, add Tickets 🎫 tab, move Inbox to position 2 with
        coral dot badge variant.

═══ P1 — Major new screens (high impact) ═══
  P1.1  Payment + drinks checkout screen (`payment-screen.tsx`): cinema layout with qty steppers,
        payment method radios, live total, Stripe CTA, skip-drinks link.
  P1.2  Confirmation screen (`confirmation-screen.tsx`): teal success banner + receipt + QR + chat
        preview combined. "Open chat" + "View QR" side-by-side CTAs.
  P1.3  QR check-in / Tickets screen (`tickets-screen.tsx`): large QR, pre-order amber pill chips,
        guest-list confirmation, gradient scan CTA.
  P1.4  Host dashboard screen (`host-dashboard-screen.tsx`): stat grid 2x2 (Confirmed/Profit/Pending/
        Pre-orders), guest list with pre-order badges, prep list with profit-per-item, earnings card,
        "Scan guests in ▦" CTA.
  P1.5  Admin controls screen (`admin-screen.tsx`): pending requests approve/decline, confirmed guests
        remove, 3 party-control toggles (Approval required / Accept new joiners / Menu ordering open),
        guest cap stepper, red auto-refund remove card.
  P1.6  Countdown + location drop screen (`countdown-screen.tsx`): vertical step tracker (5 steps
        with done/active/pending states), coral location-drop alert, mini location card, chat preview.
  P1.7  Filter screen (`filter-screen.tsx`): profession pills, price slider with thumb, city picker,
        date filter pills, "Show N matching parties" CTA.

═══ P2 — Significant updates to existing screens ═══
  P2.1  Redesign home-screen.tsx: card with m-pill.theme (bottom-left) + m-pill.spots (bottom-right),
        2-tab switcher (House parties / Social meetups), search bar, "Happening near you · N vibes"
        sub-header, m-tag.menu amber variant for parties with menus.
  P2.2  Redesign detail-screen.tsx: m-hero with theme+spots pills + back/share round buttons,
        meta grid 2x2, host card with verified badge, guest initials row (locked names), m-lock
        "Full names visible after payment", menu preview section, "Join for £N · get your spot" CTA.
  P2.3  Update chat-screen.tsx: align bubble styles (theirs = rgba white/7 with 4px 8px 8px 8px radius,
        mine = rgba purple/40 with 8px 4px 8px 8px radius, #EEEDFE text).
  P2.4  Update requests-screen.tsx to feed into the new Admin Controls screen (or merge).

═══ P3 — Polish / nice-to-have ═══
  P3.1  Glass effect on app-shell top bar (backdrop-filter blur 16px, rgba bg).
  P3.2  Phone-style rounded frame for the app container (32px radius, subtle purple border).
  P3.3  Float animation on hero/featured cards (translateY -10px over 4s).
  P3.4  Vertical step-tracker pattern for any multi-step flow (countdown, onboarding, checkout).
  P3.5  Pre-order amber pill chips pattern (for any "items reserved" UI).
  P3.6  Toggle switches with purple thumb (22x12 pill, 8px round white thumb right-aligned).
  P3.7  Quantity steppers (13px round +/− buttons, used for cart and guest-cap).
  P3.8  Stat tiles with Syne-font numbers (13px/700) + 6px label.
  P3.9  Eyebrow component (10px uppercase purple + 20px line decoration) for section labels.
  P3.10 Marketing-style closing card "No profiles. No pressure. No big clubs…" (could be a
        post-logout or first-launch splash).

═══ Open Questions for the implementation agent ═══
  Q1. Does the spec require removing the existing login/onboarding/profile/edit-profile/saved/
      my-parties/map screens entirely, or just not featuring them in this 11-slide deck?
      (Recommendation: KEEP login/onboarding/profile/edit-profile/saved — they're infrastructure.
       REPURPOSE my-parties → Host Dashboard. REMOVE map-screen as standalone OR keep it but
       demote to a hidden route since spec uses an embedded mini-map card instead.)
  Q2. Does the Stripe integration need to actually charge real money, or is a mock payment
      sufficient for this iteration? (Spec copy says "Secured by Stripe" but in dev/demo
      mode a mock pay button that drops user into confirmation screen is acceptable.)
  Q3. For QR codes: use a real QR-code library (e.g. qrcode.react) or use a placeholder "▦"
      emoji as the spec mockup does? (Recommendation: real QR for production-feel.)
  Q4. Should the existing `requests-screen.tsx` (host-side join requests) be merged into the
      new `admin-screen.tsx`, or kept separate? (Spec's Admin Controls has pending requests
      section, so they overlap — recommend MERGING.)
  Q5. Map screen — keep the existing Leaflet+CARTO implementation, or remove it entirely
      in favor of the spec's mini location card? (Recommendation: keep map-screen.tsx as a
      secondary route accessible from the Countdown mini-card "Open full map" link, but remove
      it from the bottom nav per the spec.)

Task ID: 7-d
Agent: subagent (confirmation-screen)
Task: Build confirmation-screen.tsx (Confirmation + Chat Unlocked per spec slide 5)

Work Log:
- Read worklog ANALYZE-1 spec, globals.css (teal-foil / purple-foil / glass / glow-cyan / glow-violet / eyebrow / animate-pop-in / animate-screen-in utilities), types.ts (Order/OrderItem/Party, currencyForCity, formatDateLabel, formatTime), api.ts (api.listOrders), store.ts (selectedOrderId, currentUser, setScreen, goBack), detail-screen.tsx (sticky header + ChevronLeft + Skeleton conventions).
- Confirmed package.json has NO qrcode dependency → used the "▦" emoji placeholder per spec.
- Built `/home/z/my-project/src/screens/confirmation-screen.tsx`:
  - "use client"; useQuery(["orders", currentUser.id], api.listOrders({userId})) then find by selectedOrderId.
  - Loading: sticky glass-strong header skeleton + body skeleton stack matching the layout (banner / receipt / QR / chat / 2-CTA row).
  - Not-found / error: glass-strong sticky header with back button, centered card with coral-foil icon, "Order not found" heading, copy + Back-to-home CTA (setScreen("home")).
  - Body: sticky header (back ChevronLeft + "Confirmed" eyebrow + "You're in" font-display heading) → scrollable p-4 pb-32 space-y-4:
    * Success banner: teal-foil rounded-3xl p-5 with animate-pop-in; 32px circular bg-teal-500 white Check (glow-cyan, strokeWidth 3); "You're in. Spot secured." text-teal-300; "{party.title} · {formatDateLabel} · {formatTime}" + "Group chat is now unlocked" muted.
    * Receipt card: glass rounded-2xl, "Receipt" eyebrow + order.status badge; line items "{emoji} {name} × {qty} — {sym}{unitPrice*qty.toFixed(2)}"; total row (top border, "Total paid" + "{sym}{order.totalAmount.toFixed(2)}" in text-primary).
    * QR card: glass rounded-2xl centered; 80x80 bg-white/8 border border-border rounded-xl with "▦" at 32px; "Your entry QR" label + muted "Show at the door…" copy.
    * Chat preview: purple-foil rounded-2xl; header "Group chat · {guestCount+1} people" with MessageCircle icon + "Unlocked" badge; 3 mock bubbles (host left with avatar initial + 4px 12px 12px 12px radius bg-white/8; guest left same shape; "you" right with 12px 4px 12px 12px radius bg-purple-500/40 text-purple-foreground); disabled input row "Message the group…" visual only.
    * CTAs: grid grid-cols-2 gap-3; "Open chat" bg-primary text-primary-foreground glow-violet (→ setScreen("inbox")); "View QR" border border-purple-500/40 text-purple-300 bg-transparent (→ setScreen("tickets")).
  - Currency resolved via currencyForCity(order.party.city).
- Verification: `bun run lint` → 0 errors. `npx tsc --noEmit | grep confirmation-screen` → empty (no TS errors in this file; remaining pre-existing errors are in scripts/seed-uk.ts, examples/websocket, skills/, and orders route — outside this task's scope).

Stage Summary:
- New screen `src/screens/confirmation-screen.tsx` (~230 lines) implementing spec slide 5 (Confirmation + Chat Unlocked) in the new purple/teal/amber/coral multi-color palette on near-black #09080f. Loads order via api.listOrders + selectedOrderId; handles loading / not-found states; renders success banner, receipt, QR placeholder, mock group-chat preview, and dual CTAs. Lint + tsc clean for the new file. Ready to be wired into the app shell by the orchestrator (screen routes through `setScreen("confirmation")` already exists in the Screen union type).

Task ID: 7-e
Agent: subagent (tickets-screen)
Task: Build tickets-screen.tsx (QR Check-in per spec slide 7)

Work Log:
- Read context: worklog ANALYZE-1 section (P1.3 — QR check-in / Tickets screen: large QR, pre-order amber pill chips, guest-list confirmation, gradient scan CTA), globals.css utilities (glass, glass-strong, teal-foil, purple-foil, coral-foil, vibe-gradient-bg, eyebrow, glow-violet, vibe-float, press-feedback, fancy-scrollbar, vibe-skeleton), lib/types.ts (Ticket/Order/OrderItem/Party, currencyForCity, formatDateLabel, formatTime), lib/api.ts (api.listTickets returns { tickets } with party + order.items joined), lib/store.ts (currentUser, setScreen), home-screen.tsx (screen conventions: sticky header pattern, useQuery, animate-screen-in wrapper from app-shell).
- Confirmed qrcode npm package is NOT in package.json (per task instructions: don't install new packages). Will render a stylized CSS-grid QR placeholder.
- Confirmed existing bottom-nav.tsx already routes "tickets" tab to setScreen("tickets") and app-shell.tsx was missing the tickets case (would render blank). Wired TicketsScreen into app-shell.tsx (import + render branch).
- Built /home/z/my-project/src/screens/tickets-screen.tsx:
  • "use client".
  • useQuery(["tickets", currentUser.id], () => api.listTickets(currentUser.id)) with enabled: !!currentUser?.id guard.
  • Sticky header (sticky top-0 z-10 glass-strong px-4 py-3 pt-[max(env(safe-area-inset-top),12px)]) — eyebrow "My tickets" + h1 "Show QR at the door". No back button (tab destination).
  • Scrollable body: fancy-scrollbar flex-1 overflow-y-auto p-4 pb-32 space-y-4.
  • Loading → 2× TicketSkeleton (h-72 QR card + h-16 confirmation, vibe-skeleton shimmer).
  • Error → centered card with RefreshCw in coral-foil, "Couldn't load tickets" headline, retry button.
  • Empty → centered card with TicketIcon lucide icon in purple-foil + glow-violet + vibe-float animation, "No tickets yet" headline, "Join a party to get your entry QR" subtext, "Explore parties" CTA (bg-primary text-primary-foreground) → setScreen("home").
  • Tickets list → one TicketCard per ticket (key=t.id).
  • TicketCard composition:
      1. Big QR card (glass rounded-2xl p-5 centered): party title (font-display text-2xl font-bold text-white); "{dateLabel} · {timeLabel} · {party.area}" muted text-xs; QRPlaceholder (120×120, white bg, rounded-xl, grid of 7×7 cells with 2px gap); "Scan this QR code at the door" muted text-xs; amber pill chips for pre-order items (bg-amber-500/15 text-amber-300 border border-amber-500/30 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-xs, "{emoji} {name} × {qty}") or "Entry only" muted chip if no add-ons; "Pre-orders flagged when scanned · host has them ready" tiny muted footnote.
      2. Guest-list confirmation (teal-foil rounded-2xl p-4, mt-3-equivalent via space-y-3): teal check circle + "You're on the guest list" (text-teal-300 font-semibold) + "Approved by host · spot confirmed" (muted).
      3. "Your order at the door" section (only when addOns.length > 0): glass rounded-2xl p-4 with QrCode lucide icon + eyebrow header; <ul> of "{emoji} {name} × {qty}" on the left and "{sym}{(unitPrice * qty).toFixed(2)}" on the right in text-primary (purple) font-semibold. Uses currencyForCity(ticket.party.city).
      4. CTA button (vibe-gradient-bg purple→teal, text-white, rounded-2xl w-full, px-4 py-3.5, glow shadow + press-feedback + hover:brightness-110): TicketIcon + "Ready · show QR to host". onClick → toast.success("Show this to your host 🎟️") via sonner.
  • QR placeholder implementation (no qrcode package): 
      - QR_N = 7 constant.
      - hashSeed(hash): FNV-1a 32-bit hash for deterministic seed.
      - finderZone(r, c): returns "tl"/"tr"/"bl"/null for the 3 classic QR corner positions (each 3×3).
      - finderValue(r, c): classic QR finder look — 3×3 outer dark ring + 1×1 dark center, light mid-edges (computes local coords per finder).
      - qrGrid(hash): returns boolean[7][7]; finder cells use finderValue, data cells use seed-derived bit ((seed >>> ((r*7+c) % 31)) & 1).
      - QRPlaceholder component: useMemo to compute grid from qrHash; renders 7×7 CSS grid (grid-cols-7 grid-rows-7 gap-[2px]) inside a 120×120 white box with p-2 rounded-xl; each cell is bg-[#09080f] (dark, matches app bg) or bg-white (light).
  • preOrderItems(t) helper: filters t.order.items where menuItemId !== null/undefined (entry ticket item has menuItemId=null per /api/orders POST handler).
  • All colors per task spec: purple (primary, eyebrow, glow-violet, purple-foil), teal (teal-foil, text-teal-300, bg-teal-500/15), amber (bg-amber-500/15 text-amber-300 border-amber-500/30), coral (coral-foil for error). vibe-gradient-bg for CTA. No legacy yellow-400 monochrome carried over.
- Verification:
  • `bun run lint` → 0 errors (eslint . passes clean).
  • `npx tsc --noEmit | grep tickets-screen` → no errors in tickets-screen.tsx or app-shell.tsx. (Pre-existing errors in unrelated files: examples/websocket/server.ts, scripts/seed-uk.ts, skills/*, src/app/api/orders/route.ts — none touched by this task.)

Stage Summary:
- New screen /home/z/my-project/src/screens/tickets-screen.tsx (~270 lines) implements the spec slide 7 "My Tickets / QR Check-in" view: sticky header, empty state with purple Ticket icon + Explore parties CTA, ticket cards each containing a stylized 7×7 QR placeholder (with 3 classic finder patterns) + party/date/time/area header, amber pre-order pill chips (or "Entry only"), teal guest-list confirmation, optional "Your order at the door" itemized list with purple prices, and a vibe-gradient-bg "Ready · show QR to host" CTA firing a sonner success toast.
- Wired the screen into app-shell.tsx (import + render branch for current === "tickets"), so the existing bottom-nav "Tickets" tab now actually renders content instead of a blank page.
- Lint clean, TypeScript clean for the touched files. No new npm packages installed (qrcode not present, used CSS-grid placeholder per spec).

Task ID: 7-c
Agent: subagent (payment-screen)
Task: Build payment-screen.tsx (Payment + Drinks Checkout per spec slide 4)

Work Log:
- Read worklog.md ANALYZE-1 section (lines 830-1559) for the full multi-color design spec; confirmed slide 4 = "Payment + Drinks" (Step 4 of 9, "Confirm your spot", cinema-style checkout).
- Read globals.css to inventory utility classes (glass, glass-strong, purple-foil, teal-foil, amber-foil, coral-foil, eyebrow, glow-violet, vibe-skeleton, animate-stagger, animate-screen-in, fancy-scrollbar) and CSS variables (purple #534ab7, teal #1d9e75, amber #ef9f27, coral #d85a30, bg #09080f, primary = purple).
- Read types.ts for MenuItem/Order/OrderItem shapes + currencyForCity/formatDateLabel/formatTime helpers; api.ts for api.getParty / api.listMenu / api.createOrder signatures; store.ts for selectedPartyId/setSelectedOrderId/setScreen/goBack/currentUser.
- Read detail-screen.tsx + create-screen.tsx for screen conventions (sticky glass header with ChevronLeft back button, pt-[max(env(safe-area-inset-top),12px)], fancy-scrollbar flex-1 overflow-y-auto body, animate-screen-in wrapper, useQuery + useMutation patterns, sonner toast).
- Verified /api/orders POST route accepts { userId, partyId, items[{ menuItemId?, name, emoji, unitPrice, quantity }] } and returns { order, ticket } — matches the createOrder client helper exactly.
- Built /home/z/my-project/src/screens/payment-screen.tsx (374 lines):
  • "use client" component PaymentScreen.
  • useQuery(["party", partyId]) + useQuery(["menu", partyId]) with enabled: !!partyId.
  • Local state: quantities (Record<string, number>, default 0), paymentMethod ("visa"|"applepay"|"googlepay", default "visa"), submitting (bool).
  • Computed: menuTotal + entryFee → total (live, useMemo).
  • formatPrice(n) = `${currencyForCity(party.city)}${n.toFixed(2)}` → "£7.00".
  • useMutation(api.createOrder) → onSuccess: setSelectedOrderId(order.id) + toast.success("Spot secured!") + setScreen("confirmation"); onError: toast.error("Payment failed — try again").
  • submit(skipDrinks) builds items[] = [Entry ticket 🎟️ qty 1] + (unless skip) each menu item with qty>0; calls mutate with onSettled → setSubmitting(false).
  • Sticky glass header: ChevronLeft back button + eyebrow "Step 4 of 9 · Checkout" + h1 "Confirm your spot" + subtitle "{party.title} · {formatDateLabel(party.date)}".
  • Entry ticket card (glass, purple-foil icon tile) — "1 × entry ticket", fee in purple-300, "Fixed" tag.
  • Drinks & snacks card (glass) — header + teal-foil "Optional" badge + subtitle "Like ordering at a cinema — pick up at the door" + menu rows (emoji + name + purple price + 32px round −/qty/+ stepper, − disabled at 0).
  • Payment method card (glass) — 3 custom radio rows (Visa 4242 default-selected with solid purple dot, Apple Pay, Google Pay); selected row gets purple-foil background.
  • Total row: border-t border-border, "Total" + add-on count label, large font-display text-primary purple total.
  • CTA Button: bg-primary text-primary-foreground glow-violet rounded-2xl h-12 — "Pay £X.XX · confirm spot 🔒" with Lock icon; spinner + "Processing…" while submitting.
  • Skip link: text-purple-300/70 hover:text-purple-300 — "Skip drinks for now · entry only" → submit(true).
  • Footer micro: ShieldCheck + "Secured by Stripe · refundable if host cancels" (10px muted, centered).
  • Guards: no partyId/currentUser → minimal empty state with "Browse parties" button; party loading → Skeleton layout mirroring the real structure.
  • Staggered entrance: each card uses animate-stagger with incremental animationDelay (40/100/160ms).
- Verification:
  • `bun run lint` → 0 errors (eslint . passes clean).
  • `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors in payment-screen.tsx (14 pre-existing errors in other files: websocket example, seed-uk script, skills, orders GET route, and the not-yet-created tickets-screen import — all outside this task's scope).

Stage Summary:
- payment-screen.tsx is complete and matches the spec slide 4 design: cinema-style checkout with entry ticket (fixed), drinks/snacks qty steppers (teal "Optional" badge), 3-option payment radio list (Visa/Apple Pay/Google Pay), live total, purple glowing Pay CTA, skip-drinks link, and Stripe footer micro-copy. All on the multi-color purple/teal palette on near-black #09080f.
- API contract verified end-to-end against /api/orders POST route — the items[] shape, currency derivation, and { order, ticket } response are all aligned.
- Screen is ready to be wired into app-shell.tsx by the orchestrator (needs `{current === "payment" && <PaymentScreen />}` added alongside the existing tickets/confirmation/countdown cases that sibling agents are building).
- No concerns blocking merge; the only follow-up is the app-shell wiring + ensuring a downstream "confirmation" screen exists to receive the setSelectedOrderId + setScreen("confirmation") handoff (sibling task 7-d/7-e).

Task ID: 7-f
Agent: subagent (host-dashboard-screen)
Task: Build host-dashboard-screen.tsx (Host Dashboard per spec slide 8)

Work Log:
- Read worklog ANALYZE-1 section (slides 8 detail at lines 1145-1173), globals.css utilities (eyebrow, glass, glass-strong, vibe-gradient-bg, purple-foil, teal-foil, amber-foil, coral-foil, glow-violet, vibe-skeleton, press-feedback), types.ts (Party/Order/OrderItem/MenuItem/HostAnalytics/JoinRequest + currencyForCity/formatDateLabel/formatTime), api.ts (getParty/listOrders/listMenu/getHostAnalytics), store.ts (currentUser/selectedPartyId/setScreen/goBack), existing host-analytics.tsx (for StatCard/FunnelPill patterns), my-parties-screen.tsx (header/body conventions), confirmation-screen.tsx (for the new multi-color palette + sticky-header back-button pattern), and bottom-nav.tsx (which already wires "host-dashboard" as an active profile-tab screen).
- Wrote /home/z/my-project/src/screens/host-dashboard-screen.tsx — full screen component (~430 lines) implementing spec slide 8.
- All React hooks (4× useQuery + 4× useMemo) hoisted above any early returns to comply with rules-of-hooks; the !party / loading / no-selectedPartyId branches all come after the derivation memos.
- Derived data: confirmedGuests = party.guestCount; capacity = party.maxGuests; pending = (requests.filter pending).length, falling back to analytics.pendingRequests when the party endpoint omits requests; preOrderCount = sum of OrderItem.quantity across orders (excluding "Entry ticket"); prepList = aggregated by item name with menu fallback for emoji/unitPrice; ticketRevenue = confirmedGuests × party.fee; menuProfit = Σ(totalQty × unitPrice); netProfit = ticketRevenue + menuProfit.
- Guest list rows built by mapping accepted requests → matching order by requesterId===order.userId → addOns = order.items minus Entry ticket. Badge = teal-foil "{emoji}×{qty}" join with " · " when add-ons exist, else muted "Entry only".
- Sticky header: ChevronLeft + eyebrow "Host dashboard" + party title (truncate) + "{formatDateLabel} · {formatTime} · {party.area}" subline.
- Stat grid 2×2 (grid grid-cols-2 gap-3): Confirmed (purple Users, "{n}/{cap}"), Est. net profit (teal TrendingUp, "£X"), Pending (amber Clock), Pre-orders (purple ShoppingBag). Each card = glass rounded-2xl p-4 with tinted icon tile (bg-*-500/15) + font-display text-2xl font-bold colored value + text-xs muted label.
- Prep list section: eyebrow "Prep list — buy exactly this" + glass card with divide-y rows "{emoji} {name} — {qty} ordered ... +{sym}{profit.toFixed(2)}" (profit in text-teal-300). Empty state when prepList.length===0.
- Earnings card: glass rounded-2xl p-4 with eyebrow + "Projected" eyebrow tag, two EarningRows (Ticket revenue, Menu profit), border-t separator, "Est. net profit" row in text-teal-300 font-display text-lg font-bold.
- CTA: vibe-gradient-bg glow-violet press-feedback rounded-2xl full-width button "Scan guests in ▦" with ScanLine icon; onClick fires toast.success("QR scanner opening…", { description }).
- Skeleton mirrors layout (header + 4-stat grid + 3-guest rows + 3-prep rows + earnings card + CTA bar) using vibe-skeleton class.
- Empty state (no selectedPartyId): purple-foil icon tile + "No party selected" + "Go to My Parties" button → setScreen("my-parties").
- Error state (party undefined after loading): coral-foil ⚠ tile + retry button → partyQuery.refetch().
- Verification:
  • `bun run lint` → 0 errors (eslint . passes clean).
  • `npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep host-dashboard` → 0 errors in this file (15 pre-existing errors in unrelated files: websocket example, seed-uk script, skills/, orders GET route — none in src/screens/host-dashboard-screen.tsx).

Stage Summary:
- host-dashboard-screen.tsx is complete and matches spec slide 8 design: sticky header with eyebrow+title+date·time·area; 2×2 stat grid (purple Confirmed / teal Est. net profit / amber Pending / purple Pre-orders); guest list with rotating purple/teal/amber/coral avatar initials and teal-foil pre-order badges vs muted "Entry only"; prep list with teal profit-per-item; earnings card (Ticket revenue + Menu profit + teal net-profit total with top-border separator); full-width vibe-gradient-bg "Scan guests in ▦" CTA firing a toast.success on tap. Loading skeleton, empty state, and error state all match the layout. All on the multi-color purple/teal/amber/coral palette on near-black #09080f.
- Screen is ready to be wired into app-shell.tsx by the orchestrator (needs `{current === "host-dashboard" && <HostDashboardScreen />}` added alongside the other profile-tab screens). The bottom-nav already marks "host-dashboard" as part of the Profile tab's active set, so navigation will light up correctly.
- No concerns blocking merge; downstream wiring is the orchestrator's responsibility.

Task ID: 7-g
Agent: subagent (admin-screen)
Task: Build admin-screen.tsx (Admin Controls per spec slide 9)

Work Log:
- Read worklog ANALYZE-1 section (slide 9 detail at lines 1175-1199), globals.css utilities (eyebrow, glass, glass-strong, purple-foil, teal-foil, amber-foil, coral-foil, red-foil, glow-violet, vibe-skeleton, press-feedback, fancy-scrollbar, animate-screen-in), types.ts (Party with approvalRequired/acceptJoiners/menuOpen/maxGuests + JoinRequest status enum), api.ts (getParty returns { party, host, vibes, requests } + updateRequest(id, "accepted"|"rejected")), store.ts (selectedPartyId + goBack), requests-screen.tsx (conventions for useMutation + invalidateQueries patterns + AVATAR_COLORS rotation), and host-dashboard-screen.tsx (sibling screen — sticky-header + Skeleton + empty/error state patterns + 4-color avatar palette to keep visual parity).
- Wrote /home/z/my-project/src/screens/admin-screen.tsx — full screen component (~530 lines) implementing spec slide 9 design end-to-end.
- All React hooks (useQuery + useMutation + useMemo × 2 + useState × 4) hoisted above any early returns to comply with rules-of-hooks; the !selectedPartyId / loading / error branches all come after the derivation.
- Pending vs confirmed split via useMemo on requests.filter — pending.status === "pending", confirmed.status === "accepted".
- Approve/Decline: useMutation(api.updateRequest) — on success toast.success("Guest approved ✅" / "Request declined") with description, then invalidate ["party", partyId] + ["parties"] + ["requests"] queries so guest counts and lists refresh. Buttons disabled while their specific request is in-flight (actMutation.isPending && actMutation.variables?.id === req.id).
- Toggle component: custom 44×24 (h-6 w-11) rounded-full switch, bg-purple-500 when ON else bg-secondary, white 18px (h-4 w-4) thumb translated +6 (translate-x-6) when ON, role="switch" aria-checked, focus-visible ring. Inline at top of file.
- Party controls card (glass rounded-2xl p-4): eyebrow + 3 ToggleRow (Approval required / Accept new joiners / Menu ordering open) with hint subtitles, divided by divide-y divide-white/5; bottom border-t Guest cap row with 36px (h-9 w-9) round − / + buttons (Minus/Plus icons) and font-display value, Minus disabled at cap=1.
- Local control state pattern: useState<boolean | undefined>(undefined) for each toggle + guestCap, derived display values (approval/joiners/menu/cap) fall back to party defaults via `??` — this avoids the lint-disallowed setState-in-effect cascade while still letting user overrides win after first interaction.
- Confirmed guests: avatar + name + teal Check icon (strokeWidth=3) + red-foil "Remove" button → toast.success("Guest removed", { description: "Full refund sent automatically · removed from chat." }) + invalidate party query (visual only — no PATCH endpoint yet).
- Danger zone: red-foil rounded-2xl p-4 card with ShieldAlert icon + "Remove guest · pick a reason" heading in text-red-300 + "Full refund sent automatically · removed from chat" subtext in text-red-300/70 + audit-trail note. Visual warning per spec — actual remove buttons are inline on the confirmed guests list above.
- Warning banner: amber-foil rounded-2xl p-3 with ⚠ glyph + "{N} {guest|guests} waiting for approval" in text-amber-300 — only renders when pendingCount > 0.
- Sticky header: ChevronLeft back button + eyebrow "Admin controls" + h1 "Guest management" + party.title subline (truncated). Loading → AdminSkeleton mirrors the layout (banner + 2 pending rows + 2 confirmed rows + 4-row party controls + danger zone). Empty state (no selectedPartyId): purple-foil Users icon + "Select a party" + helper text. Error state: coral-foil ⚠ + Retry button → partyQuery.refetch().
- Body wrapper: fancy-scrollbar flex-1 space-y-5 overflow-y-auto p-4 pb-32 (matches sibling screens).
- Verification:
  • `bun run lint` → 0 errors (eslint . passes clean).
  • `npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep admin-screen` → 0 errors in this file (pre-existing errors only in unrelated files: websocket example, seed-uk script, skills/, orders GET route).

Stage Summary:
- admin-screen.tsx is complete and matches spec slide 9 design: sticky header with eyebrow + "Guest management" subtitle; conditional amber warning banner for pending count; Pending requests list with avatar + name + intro-subtext + teal Approve / red Decline buttons (useMutation wired to api.updateRequest with toast + query invalidation); Confirmed guests list with avatar + name + teal ✓ checkmark + red Remove button (toast on click); glass Party controls card with 3 purple toggle rows (Approval required / Accept new joiners / Menu ordering open) + Guest cap stepper (− {N} + with 36px round buttons); red-foil danger-zone card with "Remove guest · pick a reason" heading and "Full refund sent automatically · removed from chat" subtext. Toggle switch is a real 44×24 pill (purple ON, secondary OFF, sliding white thumb, role="switch" + aria-checked). All on the multi-color purple/teal/amber/coral palette on near-black #09080f.
- All React hooks hoisted above conditional returns. Local control state uses an undefined-until-touched pattern to avoid setState-in-effect (lint-clean) while still hydrating from party defaults on first paint.
- Screen is ready to be wired into app-shell.tsx by the orchestrator (needs `{current === "admin" && <AdminScreen />}` added alongside the other host-flow screens). The "admin" Screen type already exists in types.ts.
- No concerns blocking merge; downstream wiring (app-shell + entry point from host-dashboard or my-parties) is the orchestrator's responsibility.

Task ID: 7-i
Agent: subagent (filter-screen)
Task: Build filter-screen.tsx (Filter per spec slide 2)

Work Log:
- Read worklog ANALYZE-1 section (spec slide 2 — Filter: profession pills, price-range slider card, city pills, date pills, sticky bottom CTA with matching-party count), globals.css (utilities: glass, glass-strong, eyebrow, purple-foil, glow-violet, press-feedback, fancy-scrollbar, animate-screen-in), lib/types.ts (CITIES, PROFESSIONS), lib/store.ts (cityFilter/setCityFilter, setScreen, goBack), lib/api.ts (api.listParties), home-screen.tsx conventions (useQuery + queryKey pattern), confirmation-screen.tsx (sticky header pattern: `sticky top-0 z-20 glass-strong pt-[max(env(safe-area-inset-top),12px)]`), detail-screen.tsx (sticky bottom CTA at `absolute inset-x-0 bottom-[84px] z-30 mx-auto max-w-[480px]`), payment-screen.tsx (radio/pill button styling, Button + glow-violet), shadcn Slider component (data-slot attributes — track/range/thumb customizable via arbitrary variant `[&_[data-slot=slider-thumb]]:...`).
- Built `/home/z/my-project/src/screens/filter-screen.tsx` (215 lines): `"use client"`; sticky header with back button + "Filter parties" font-display title + visual-only Settings2 (gear) icon button in `purple-foil`; scrollable body (`p-4 pb-40 space-y-6`) with 4 sections — (1) "Who are you?" profession pills from `PROFESSIONS`, single-select via local `profession` state, tapping selected deselects; (2) "Price range" `glass rounded-2xl p-4` card with shadcn `Slider` (min=0, max=15, step=1, default=9 for "Up to £9"), styled via `[&_[data-slot=slider-track]]:h-[3px]`, `[&_[data-slot=slider-track]]:bg-secondary`, `[&_[data-slot=slider-range]]:bg-purple-500`, `[&_[data-slot=slider-thumb]]:size-5 border-2 border-white bg-purple-500` to match spec (3px track, purple fill, 20px white-bordered purple thumb), plus 5 evenly-spaced labels (Free / £4 / £8 / £12 / £15+) and live "Up to £{value}" label in `text-purple-300`; (3) "City" pills bound directly to `cityFilter`/`setCityFilter` from store so it syncs with home (single-select, tapping selected deselects); (4) "Date" pills (Tonight / This weekend / Next week) on local `dateFilter` state (default "weekend"). All pills use the spec colors: selected = `bg-purple-500/30 text-purple-200 border border-purple-500/50`, unselected = `bg-secondary text-muted-foreground border border-border`.
- Sticky bottom CTA bar at `absolute inset-x-0 bottom-[84px] z-30 mx-auto max-w-[480px] px-3` (sits above the 80px-tall bottom nav) wrapping a `glass-strong` container with a full-width `bg-primary text-primary-foreground rounded-2xl h-12 glow-violet` button labeled "Show {N} matching parties" (or "Counting…" with a spinner while loading). N comes from `useQuery(["parties","filter",cityFilter,profession,priceValue,dateFilter], () => api.listParties({ city: cityFilter }))` — approximate count since API only supports city/vibe/q.
- Registered `FilterScreen` in `src/components/vibe/app-shell.tsx` (import + `{current === "filter" && <FilterScreen />}` route). Preserved the parallel `CountdownScreen` import/route another agent added.
- Verified: `bun run lint` → 0 errors; `npx tsc --noEmit | grep filter-screen` → 0 errors in my file (remaining TS errors are all in unrelated files: scripts/seed-uk.ts, examples/websocket/server.ts, skills/*, src/app/api/orders/route.ts).

Stage Summary:
- New screen `src/screens/filter-screen.tsx` (215 LOC) implements spec slide 2: dedicated Filter UI with profession/price-slider/city/date sections, sticky header with gear icon, sticky bottom CTA showing live matching-party count, full multi-color palette (purple-dominant on near-black #09080f). City filter is live-synced with the Zustand store so the apply-CTA simply calls `setScreen("home")` (city already persisted). Profession/price/date are UI-only for now (no API/store support — noted as approximate in the count query). Slider styled purple via `[&_[data-slot=...]]` arbitrary variants on the shadcn Slider. App-shell routes `screen === "filter"` to FilterScreen. Lint + tsc clean for the new file.

Task ID: 7-h
Agent: subagent (countdown-screen)
Task: Build countdown-screen.tsx (Countdown + Location Drop per spec slide 6)

Work Log:
- Read worklog ANALYZE-1 spec (slide 6 lines 1092-1116 — "Step 6 of 9 · Guest · ENTIRELY NEW SCREEN": teal countdown pill, vertical m-steps tracker with 5 steps, coral location-drop alert, purple location card, purple party-chat preview), globals.css utilities (teal-foil / purple-foil / coral-foil / amber-foil / glass / glass-strong / eyebrow / glow-violet / glow-cyan / animate-pop-in / animate-screen-in / fancy-scrollbar / vibe-skeleton), types.ts (Party with locationRevealAt + countdownTo + formatDateLabel + formatTime), api.ts (api.getParty + api.listTickets), store.ts (currentUser, selectedPartyId, setScreen, goBack), detail-screen.tsx + confirmation-screen.tsx for sticky-header + chat-bubble + Skeleton conventions.
- Verified Tailwind v4 setup: only `--color-coral` (single shade) is defined in @theme, so `text-coral-300` does NOT exist — used `text-orange-300` per task instructions (default Tailwind orange-300 ≈ coral-bright #f0997b). `text-teal-300` / `text-purple-300` / `text-amber-300` are default Tailwind colors and work fine.
- Built /home/z/my-project/src/screens/countdown-screen.tsx (~330 lines):
  - "use client"; two useQuery hooks (party by selectedPartyId, tickets by currentUser.id) hoisted above any conditional returns to comply with rules-of-hooks.
  - Sticky header: ChevronLeft back button + truncated party title + teal-foil pill showing `countdownTo(party.date, party.time)` (e.g. "in 3d 4h", "Live now").
  - Step tracker (glass card) — 5 steps with 28px circular dots and 1px vertical connectors between rows:
    1 ✓ done — "Spot confirmed" / "Receipt sent to email"
    2 ✓ done — "Group chat unlocked" / "Meet everyone before arriving"
    3 ● active/pending — "Reminders coming" / "24hr + 2hr push notifications"
    4 ○ active/pending — "Location drops day-of" / "Map pin at {revealTime} on {revealDay}" (template filled from locationRevealAt datetime)
    5 ○ active/pending — "Arrive · scan QR · collect order"
    States derived from `activeStep` computed per spec: if now > revealAt → step 5; else if now > partyStart − 24h → step 4; else step 3. Step dots: teal check (done, glow-cyan), purple number (active, glow-violet), gray number on secondary bg (pending). Connector line color: teal/45 if previous state was done, else white/10.
  - Location-drop alert (coral-foil, animate-pop-in): 📍 + `text-orange-300` "Location drops in {N} hours" (rounded-up hours, pluralised) + `text-orange-300/70` body "Map pin will appear in your group chat at {revealTime} on {revealDay}. Only visible to you and other confirmed guests." Hidden once revealDropped (now > revealAt).
  - Location card (purple-foil): MapPin icon in purple-tinted square + `{area}, {city}` in `text-purple-300` + subtext that flips between "Exact address arriving soon" (default) and "Exact address is in your group chat" (when revealDropped) + "Open full map" button → `setScreen("map")`.
  - Party chat preview (purple-foil, full-width button → setScreen("inbox")): "Party chat · {N} people 🔥" header, two mock bubbles (R on amber avatar / left / `bg-white/8`, you on right / `bg-purple-500/40 text-purple-foreground`), and a date/time hint row at the bottom with ArrowRight affordance.
  - Soft no-ticket banner (amber-foil) shown when currentUser is set but `ticketsData.tickets` has no ticket for this partyId — explains this is a preview + "View party & get a spot" CTA → `setScreen("detail")`.
  - Loading → CountdownSkeleton (sticky header skeleton + body skeletons matching final layout). Empty (no selectedPartyId / party load error) → EmptyState with CalendarClock icon and "Browse parties" CTA → setScreen("home").
- Wired CountdownScreen into app-shell.tsx: added import + `{current === "countdown" && <CountdownScreen />}` render branch alongside the other screen entries. ("countdown" Screen type already existed in types.ts.)
- Verification: `bun run lint` → 0 errors (eslint . exits clean). `npx tsc --noEmit` → no errors in countdown-screen.tsx or app-shell.tsx (pre-existing errors in unrelated files: examples/websocket, scripts/seed-uk, src/app/api/orders/route, skills/* — none touched by this task).

Stage Summary:
- countdown-screen.tsx is complete and matches spec slide 6 design end-to-end: teal countdown pill in header, 5-step vertical tracker with teal/purple/gray state dots and 1px connector lines, coral-foil location-drop alert with hours-until-reveal countdown, purple-foil location card with area + reveal-time copy + map CTA, purple-foil party-chat preview with two mock bubbles + open-chat affordance, plus an optional amber-foil "no spot yet" banner that soft-redirects to the detail screen.
- All five step states derive correctly from `activeStep` which is computed from the party's `locationRevealAt` (falling back to partyStart − 3h when not set) and current time, per the spec's pseudocode.
- Hooks comply with rules-of-hooks (both useQuery calls run unconditionally; conditional returns come after).
- Multi-color palette respected: teal for done/countdown pill, purple for active/location card/chat bubbles, coral for the location-drop urgency alert, amber for the no-spot-yet banner and chat avatar accent.
- Screen is reachable from anywhere via `setScreen("countdown")` once `selectedPartyId` is set. Detail screen / confirmation screen can add a "Countdown" CTA in a downstream wiring task; not in scope here.
- No concerns blocking merge.

- Read context: worklog.md ANALYZE-1 section (slide 3 = Party Detail, step 3 of 9 — hero with theme/spots pills, 2×2 meta grid, host card with teal Verified badge, who's going with locked initials, menu preview, Join CTA → payment), globals.css utilities (glass, glass-strong, eyebrow, vibe-float, glow-violet, coral-foil, purple-foil), types.ts (Party, MenuItem, VIBE_EMOJI, VIBE_COLORS, currencyForCity, formatFee, formatDateLabel, formatTime, parseVibes, slotsLeft), api.ts (api.getParty, api.listMenu, api.recordView), store.ts (selectedPartyId, currentUser, setScreen, goBack, toggleSaved, savedPartyIds), existing detail-screen.tsx (recordView effect, ReviewsSection integration, messageHost flow), reviews-section.tsx (KEEP as-is), confirmation-screen.tsx (new multi-color palette conventions: bg-purple-500/30, text-purple-200, bg-teal-500/25, text-teal-200, coral-foil, eyebrow utility, press-feedback, glow-violet), tailwind.config.ts + globals.css @theme block (confirmed purple-500/teal-500/amber-500/cyan-500/rose-500/green-600 are Tailwind v4 defaults that DO render; coral is custom via --color-coral so used `bg-coral`/`text-coral`/`fill-coral` instead of non-existent `bg-coral-500`).
- Rewrote /home/z/my-project/src/screens/detail-screen.tsx end-to-end:
  • Removed old yellow cover image, Drawer-based "Request to Connect" CTA, Fact component, host bio/rules sections, LiveCountdown, VibeBadge/GuestAvatars/RatingPill components (all yellow-themed).
  • New m-hero (h-44 / 176px): vibe-colored bg (VIBE_HERO_BG map: R&B/Lo-fi/EDM/BYOB → #1a1035, Games/Chill/Retro → #0d1f2d, Bollywood → #1a2410), 48px floating emoji centerpiece, top-left back button (32px round bg-black/40), top-right Share button (32px round), bottom-left theme pill (bg-black/55), bottom-right spots pill (coral when ≤2 left, purple when comfortable, "Sold out" when full).
  • Title row: party title (font-display text-xl font-bold) + fee pill (bg-purple-500/20 text-purple-300 → "{fee} entry") + subtitle "Pay once · drinks add-on available after".
  • Meta grid 2×2 (grid grid-cols-2 gap-2): 📅 date+time, 🕑 ends ~start+4h, 📍 area+city, 👥 max guests. Each cell bg-white/4 rounded-lg p-2.5 border-border/40 text-xs.
  • Tag row: VIBE_COLORS[vibe] multi-color chips + visual "21+" (coral) + "Students" (amber) tags.
  • Host card (glass rounded-2xl p-3 flex items-center gap-3): 40px purple initial avatar, name + teal "✓ Verified" badge (bg-teal-500/15 text-teal-300), amber "★★★★★" + rating + hosted count, Message button (purple outline).
  • Who's going (glass rounded-2xl p-3): eyebrow label, 4 overlapping 28px initial-circles (P/R/J/S) with rotating purple/teal/amber colors + "+N" overflow + "{going} going" text + "🔒 Full names visible after payment" muted line.
  • About section: eyebrow + party.description in text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed.
  • Menu preview (glass rounded-2xl p-3): eyebrow + up to 4 menu items with "{emoji} {name}" left + "{currency}{price}" right in text-purple-300, "+N more" overflow, "No pre-order menu" fallback.
  • ReviewsSection preserved at bottom (no changes — pre-existing yellow stars are out of scope for this task).
  • Sticky bottom CTA (fixed bottom-[84px] inset-x-0 mx-auto max-w-[480px] px-4): 48×48 save/heart button (coral when saved) + primary CTA "Join for £N · get your spot" (bg-primary text-primary-foreground glow-violet). Full → "Sold out — join waitlist" disabled style. isOwn → "Manage your party" → host-dashboard. handleJoin calls setScreen("payment") (selectedPartyId is already set in store).
  • Loading skeleton + error state preserved.
  • recordView effect preserved (still fires once per mount).
  • useQuery(["party", id]) preserved; added useQuery(["menu", id]) → api.listMenu.
  • messageHost flow kept as a secondary button on the host card.
- Verified imports: cleaned out Drawer/DrawerContent/Textarea/VibeBadge/UserAvatar/RatingPill/GuestAvatars/LiveCountdown/useMutation/useState/Sparkles/Info/Send/Check/IndianRupee/Calendar/Clock/Users/MapPin/pickGuestAvatars (all unused after redesign). Kept ChevronLeft, Share2, Heart, MessageCircle, ShieldCheck, Lock, toast, useQuery, useEffect, api, useAppStore, formatFee/formatTime/formatDateLabel/parseVibes/slotsLeft/currencyForCity, VIBE_EMOJI/VIBE_COLORS, ReviewsSection, Button, Skeleton, cn.
- Ran `bun run lint` — clean (0 errors, 0 warnings).
- Ran `npx tsc --noEmit` — no errors in detail-screen.tsx (errors in unrelated files: examples/websocket, scripts/seed-uk, skills/*, src/app/api/orders/route.ts — all pre-existing).

Stage Summary:
- Detail screen fully redesigned to spec slide 3: m-hero with theme/spots pills + back/share round buttons, 2×2 meta grid, host card with teal Verified badge, who's going with locked initials + payment-gate note, menu preview with prices, sticky "Join for £N · get your spot" CTA routing to payment screen.
- Old "Request to Connect" drawer removed; replaced by Join → payment flow (per spec). Message host preserved as a secondary action.
- Multi-color palette applied: purple primary, teal Verified, amber stars/menu tags, coral for urgency (low-spots pill + 21+ tag + saved heart). Pre-existing coral-500 utility gap noted (VIBE_COLORS EDM entry uses `bg-coral-500` which is not a Tailwind default — left as-is per task instruction to use VIBE_COLORS directly; this is a separate cleanup task).
- ReviewsSection + recordView effect preserved. Skeleton + error states preserved.
- Lint clean, tsc clean for detail-screen.tsx.

Task ID: 10 (orchestrator)

Task: Fix critical bugs (yellow theme on mobile, payment 500) + launch 4 new features (music player, filter redesign, guest TRUST rating, bouncer booking).

Work Log:
- INVESTIGATED yellow theme: found 11 components still using `yellow-400`/`yellow-300` Tailwind classes directly (rating-pill, reviews-section, guest-avatars, live-countdown, host-analytics, party-card, user-avatar, vibe-badge, map-screen, chat-screen). Bulk sed → amber-400/amber-300 across ALL src files. Verified 0 remaining `yellow-` refs.
- INVESTIGATED payment 500: POST /api/orders fails with Prisma P2003 foreign key constraint violation because the user ID in the browser's localStorage (`cmqv71gy60002rfuukktk1qm1`) doesn't exist in the DB (stale from previous session, DB was reset). 
  - API fix: added user existence validation to POST /api/orders — returns 401 with `{"error":"Your session has expired. Please log in again to continue.","code":"USER_NOT_FOUND"}` instead of 500.
  - Client fix: payment-screen.tsx onError now parses the error message — if it contains "session has expired" / "log in", shows "Session expired" toast + calls `useAppStore.getState().logout()` after 1.5s to redirect to login. Otherwise shows the actual error message.
  - App-shell fix: added a useEffect that calls `api.getUser({id: currentUser.id})` on mount — if it 404s, auto-logout so the user re-authenticates cleanly.
  - Verified: curl POST /api/orders with stale user → 401 JSON (was 500). curl with valid user → 201 order created successfully.

Stage Summary:
- Yellow theme leak: FIXED. All `yellow-*` classes replaced with `amber-*` (for gold/stars) / `purple-*` (for brand rings) / `coral-*` (for live badge). Mobile + laptop now both render the purple/dark VibeMatch theme consistently.
- Payment 500: FIXED. Root cause was stale user ID in localStorage. Three-layer fix: API validates user, client shows clear error + redirects to login, app-shell auto-validates user on load. Happy path verified working.
- Launching 4 parallel subagents for: music player, filter redesign, guest TRUST rating, bouncer booking.

  - Client: payment-screen.tsx onError parses error → shows "Session expired" toast + calls logout() after 1.5s.
  - App-shell: added useEffect that calls api.getUser({id}) on mount → auto-logout if 404.
  - Verified: valid user → 201 order created (₹3, paid). Stale user → clean 401 JSON.

  - Wired radius into home-screen feed: filters parties by haversine distance from city center when radius > 0.
  - VLM verified: "NEARBY section with km slider, 'Within 10 km' label" ✓.
- BUILT guest TRUST rating:
  - Prisma: added `TrustRating` model (partyId, hostId, guestId, rating 1-5, note) + `trustScore`/`trustCount` on User.
  - API: `POST /api/trust-ratings` (upsert + recompute aggregate) + `GET /api/trust-ratings?guestId=...`.
  - UI: TrustRatingSection on host-dashboard (5-star inline rating per guest, saves via mutation, shows "✓ Rated"). TRUST badge on profile-screen (teal pill with shield icon, score, count).
  - VLM verified: "teal TRUST badge with shield icon near user's name" ✓.
- BUILT bouncer/security booking:
  - Prisma: added `securityBooked`/`securityFee`/`securityStatus` to Party model.
  - API: parties POST route accepts + persists security fields; parties GET serializes them.

Security badge on detail-screen.tsx (teal, "Verified security on-site", "🔒 Safe").
  - VLM verified: "Security add-on section with 'Add a verified security person' + toggle" ✓, expanded view with "Why add security?", fee slider ₹1000, breakdown ₹180/₹820, verified note ✓.

Stage Summary:
- Yellow theme: FIXED. All yellow/amber-as-primary classes replaced with purple. Mobile + laptop now both render consistent purple/dark VibeMatch theme.
- Payment 500: FIXED. Stale users get clean 401 + auto-redirect to login. Valid users can pay successfully.
- Music player: SHIPPED. Intro popup + mini player bar with 5 royalty-free tracks, persists across screens.
